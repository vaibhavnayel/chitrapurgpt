Swami Vivekananda gave promise of his wonderful genius and deeply religious nature from his very childhood.\\nHe inherited the gift of dispassion from his grand father who renounced the world in his early twenties, logic and music from his lawyer father, and an unfailing memory and love for religious lore from his devout mother.\\nAs a child he attended the Metropolitan Institution, founded by Ishwar Chan dra Vidyasagar, where he gave early proofs of his exceptional intelligence.\\nThe versatile boy, in due course, attended the Presidency College, Calcutta, and acquired, under the fostering care of Principal W. W. Hastie, a thorough grasp of the masterpieces of Western Logic as well as Western Philosophy and ancient and modern history of the different nations of Europe.\\nHis study of John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer and Hume had, by this time, made him restless and question the validity of religious experience.\\nHe longed to see the unknown face to face and in order to satisfy his growing hunger, he joined the Sadharan Brahma Samaj, where his soul-stirring devotional songs were in great demand.\\nIt was at this juncture that he heard his Principal, W. W.

Caring not for his fine clothes, because he was on the way to the US Congress, Lincoln rushed and saved the animal even though it meant besplattering his dress with mud, and in the same state went to the Congress. When people congratulated him on his humane act, he brushed aside the compliments by saying that he had saved the animal to satisy himself. That was his humility.

      "Here are the relevant passages from this document: Born as Narendra Nath Datta in Calcutta, on Monday, the 12th January, 1863. Swami Vivekananda gave promise of his wonderful genius and deeply religious nature from his very childhood.\n",
      "He inherited the gift of dispassion from his grand father who renounced the world in his early twenties, logic and music from his lawyer father, and an unfailing memory and love for religious lore from his devout mother.\n",
      "As a child he attended the Metropolitan Institution, founded by Ishwar Chan dra Vidyasagar, where he gave early proofs of his exceptional intelligence.\n",
      "The versatile boy, in due course, attended the Presidency College, Calcutta, and acquired, under the fostering care of Principal W. W. Hastie, a thorough grasp of the masterpieces of Western Logic as well as Western Philosophy and ancient and modern history of the different nations of Europe.\n",
      "His study of John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer and Hume had, by this time, made him restless and question the validity of religious experience.\n",
      "He longed to see the unknown face to face and in order to satisfy his growing hunger, he joined the Sadharan Brahma Samaj, where his soul-stirring devotional songs were in great demand.\n",
      "It was at this juncture that he heard his Principal, W. W. Hastie saying that for an ocluar proof of the ecstasy expressed in certain passages of Wordsworth's poetry, one had only to go to Shri Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar whom he had witnessed as enjoying the blessed state.\n",
      "He took the Principal at his word and visited the Saint of Dakshineswar at the earliest opportunity.\n",
      "The first question that this doubting collegian asked the Master was, \"Have you seen God?\".\n",
      "\"Yes, my boy, only I see Him more clearly than I see you\" was the astounding reply that he received.\n",
      "The Master then laid his hand on Narendra's head, and blessed him when lo, he had the beatific experience of the Divine which shook him to the core.\n",
      "He rose from this experience a changed man with his spiritual vision restored and his faith in the Divine confirmed.\n",
      "The Master later called him alone in an adjoining room and disclosed to him, sobbing, that he had chalked out an important mission for him. an assignment which seemed to be utterly fantastic at the time.\n",
      "His visits to the Master increased, but the shadows of his worldly anxieties also lengthened.\n",
      "While he was yet in the Law College, his father, once a rich man but now reduced to utter poverty, passed away, leaving behind on the tender shoulders of his son, the burden of a big family.\n",
      "In those days of ex cruciating trial, poor Narendra was often seen attending the college with \"an empty stomach, coarsest garments and bare feet\".\n",
      "But his abiding faith in the Master sustained him and reduced to ashes his worldly desires and ambitions.\n",
      "He took complete refuge at the feet of his Master and quaffed the nectar of wisdom that was flowing from his lips.\n",
      "It was in the serene peace of the temple garden of Dakshineswar that he imbibed from his Master the splendid ideal of serving the God and the stricken humanity.\n",
      "The Master trained a group of disciples for the mission he was to inaugurate--disciples consisting of young educated youths who had renounced the world to carry out the great trust--and he chose Narendra as the head of this group.\n",

Everyone had to work in the world but all work should be done in a spirit of detachment.\n",
      "He cited the case of President Abraham Lincoln whose great heart was touched when he saw an animal caught in the mud and struggling to save itself. Caring not for his fine clothes, because he was on the way to the US Congress, Lincoln rushed and saved the animal even though it meant besplattering his dress with mud, and in the same state went to the Congress. When people congratulated him on his humane act, he brushed aside the compliments by saying that he had saved the animal to satisy himself. That was his humility. God was indeed ''nearest of the near\" for those who had pure minds and ''millions of miles away\" for those whose minds were impure.\n",

The Ad-hoc Committee appointed by the Mahasabha (1965)\\nto go into these problems had submitted its report and the Standing Committee\\nat its meeting held on 31st December, 1966 discussed the same and had by its\\nResolution No. 7.2 referred six of its recommendations to the Administration Sub\\nCommittee and one pertaining to Dharmaprachar to the Publications Sub-Com\\nmittee for necessary action. The Standing Committee has now to make the\\nfollowing observations in regard to this vexed problem :--\\n\\n    It is rather difficult to determine the exact number of Archaks/Purohits\\nrequired by our Community. That there is a great shortage of Vaidiks is an un\\ndisputed fact, though, at the Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali, at the moment, there\\nis no shortage of them. What is causing more concern is the steady dwindling\\ndown in their number. However, the following statistics are revealing:--\\n\\n      i) There are a little over a hundred Archaks/Purohits in our Community,\\n           including those at the Maths.\\n      ii) There are at least a dozen populous places like Madras, Calcutta, Delhi\\n           etc., where there is a demand for Vaidiks from the members of our\\n           Community.\\n     iii) There are about twenty Temples of our Community where a Chitrapur\\n           Saraswat Vaidik is not available.\\n\\n     To arrest the decline in the number of Archaks/Vaidiks, the following mea\\nsures call for consideration: --\\n\\n       i) Improve the service conditions at the Maths.\\n      ii) Ensure decent income, security of service, and dignity of the profession.\\n\\n     iii) Proper running of the Math Pathashala and encourage higher education\\n           to the deserving, even outside Shirali.\\n\\n     iv) Provide additional means of livelihood by giving training in astrology,\\n           medicines etc.\\n\\n      v) Award of prizes and scholarships.\\n\\n     vi) Recruitment to Vaidik profession from Grihistas.\\n\\n     vii) Dharmaprachar.\\n\\n     The Standing Committee has already taken the following steps:\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n46\\n\\n     Vaidiks at the Math : To ensure a decent income to the existing Vaidiks\\nand attract new entrants to the profession, the salary grades at Chitrapur Math\\nhave been revised twice since 1965. In addition to the cash emoluments, the staff\\nis entitled to free quarters, free food to themselves and their children, leave facili\\nties, gratuity and lately, to pension after retirement. The average income of a\\nVaidik at Shirali including all benefits in kind and bonus now comes to about\\nRs. 300/- per month. The entire salary bill would now amount to (for 1968/69)\\naround Rs. 80,000/- as against Rs. 48,500/- in 1964/65 on the eve of the last\\nMahasabha. Inclusive of food and house rent allowance in kind, the total expenses\\nincurred at the Math on staff are expected to exceed Rs. 1,14,000/-. Consider\\ning the economic conditions prevailing at Shirali, the present emoluments seem\\nto be satisfactory. Similar steps are contemplated to bring the staff at other\\nMaths in line with that of Shri Chitrapur Math at Shirali, so as to give effect to\\nthe scheme by the beginning of the next financial year of the Math. With the in\\ncrease in the Cash vantiga collection and improved agricultural returns from the\\nMath properties, the Standing Committee will not hesitate to improve the lot of\\nVaidiks in future.\\n\\n     Dhanna Prachar: This alone, in the opinion of the Standing Com\\nmittee, cannot solve the problem of the Vaidiks. As His Holiness Shrimat\\nAnandashram Swamiji, of revered memory, had rightly mentioned in His inau\\ngural address to the Mahasabha (1965) \"the Vaidiks do not grow on trees\". A\\ndemand has to be created for Vaidiks, which alone could attract new entrants\\nto this profession. For this, re-awakening among the laity towards religion is\\nabsolutely essential. Unless there is an awakening towards religion, a demand\\nfor Vaidiks cannot arise. If the present drift is allowed to continue, the day\\nmay not be far off when we may have to face the problem of manning the Maths\\neven. To arrest such a drift and help a re-awakening among the laity, two steps\\nwere considered by the Standing Committee :\\n\\n      i) Publication of religious literature in a language that is largely under\\nstood.\\n\\n     ii) Dharmaprachar through Pracharaks.\\n\\nItem (i) was given effect lo immediately and many publications have already been\\nmade available to the members of the Community either free or at a nominal\\ncost. As regards item (ii) the Standing Committee has not been able to imple\\nment the proposal. It was at one stage thought of to appoint two qualified\\npersons as Dharmapracharaks on decent salaries, one of whom would alterna\\ntely work as the Principal of the Math Pathashala and the other would tour\\npropagating Dharma, exchanging places every six months. This could not be\\ngiven effect to because of non-availability of suitable persons from our Com\\nmunity to undertake the work. This deserves to be pursued further and Pracha\\nraks from other Brahmin communities whose Sampradaya is in conformity with\\nthat of ours could be considered, if Pracharaks are not still available from our\\nCommunity.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nThe Math Pathashala: The Math Pathashala has been thoroughly re\\norganized and at present nine students are undergoing the prescribed curriculum\\nfor the Vaidik profession, with free education, boarding and lodging facilities.\\nAfter education at Shirali Pathashala is over, the Math would send forth deserv\\ning students to outside place for higher education at the cost of the Math. It\\nis distressing to note that no application has so far been received for Scholarship\\nfrom the Golden Jubilee Scholarship Fund for prosecuting higher education in\\nthe Vaidik profession. Successful students would be absorbed on the Math Staff\\nor sent to other places where Temples of our Community exist or where there\\nis a demand for Vaidiks in cities.\\n\\n     In spite of all these steps, the Standing Committee firmly feels, that unless the\\nlaity is inclined to perform the minimum nitya and naimittika ceremonies, the de\\nmand for Vaidiks can never be created and no amount of facilities or encourage\\nment given could attract new entrants to this profession. It is therefore, fervent\\nly hoped that the laity would take to the performance of the essential rituals of\\nthe Sanatana Dharma.\\n\\n     The Standing Committee therefore, appeals to the laity to come forward\\nand fill in the void created by the depleting Vaidiks by sending their intelligent\\nchildren for education and training as Vaidiks at the Math Pathashala, with an\\nassurance on its part, that, the children on successful conclusion of education and\\ntraining would be absorbed on the Math staff, if they so desire, or station them\\nat places where there is a demand for Vaidiks.\\n\\n                                                                      M.

This report was considered and adopted by the Standing Committee at\\nits meeting held on 31st December, 1966, and by its resolution No. 7.3 the Ad-\\nhoc Committee was requested to continue the work and suggest ways and means\\nof implementing their recommendations.\\n\\n     The Second Report dated 18th December, 1968 of the Ad-hoc Committee\\nhas also appeared in the October, 1969 issue of The Chitrapur Sunbeam. This\\nReport was also considered and adopted by the Standing Committee at its meet\\ning held on 29th December, 1968, and it was further resolved as per resolution\\n7.1 to appoint a Sub-Committee to implement the recommendations made in the\\nReport.\\n\\n     The Sub-Committee\\'s Report will be considered at the next meeting of the\\nStanding Committee to be held at Madras on 28th December, 1969, and its de\\ncisions along with the Report will be placed before the Mahasabha to be held\\nat Madras on 30th and 31st December, 1969.\\n\\n     It would appear from these reports that the problem is a stupendous one,\\nboth financially and otherwise, to rehabilitate all the Temples where they exist\\nat present. The difficulties faced in this task are manifold and, in short, may be\\nsummarized as under:\\n\\n     1. Depletion in the population of our Community in the places where these\\n        Temples exist.\\n\\n     2. Want of Archaks to man these Temples.\\n\\n     3. Finance, the main problem.\\n\\n     As could be observed from the Report, many of these Temples need reno\\nvations -- some immediately. At some places except for the Priest\\'s family,\\nwhich performs the Pooja at the Temple, no other member of the Community\\nresides. About 28 Temples belong to private families, while about 57 are managed\\nby the \"Ten\".\\n\\n     Pending the Temples and Shrines Sub-Committee\\'s Report, the following ten\\ntative measures are suggested for consideration at the Mahasabha: --\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n49\\n\\n     1. Temples, which are major and are situated at places where our Community\\n        people reside, can be managed by the local residents, any financial assista\\n        nce needed for repairs or Capital Expenses may be subsidized, as also\\n        the need of Archaks met by the Math, wherever possible. This will save\\n        marginal Temples from further deterioration.\\n\\n     2. Temples owned by families which exist solitarily and are in highly dila\\n        pidated conditions can be either pooled together and shifted to a place\\n        where our Community members reside under a common Trust or hand\\n        ed over to other Brahmin Community, which may be willing to take\\n        over the management. Wherever possible any deficit may be met from\\n         the Math funds or public donations under the auspices of the Math.\\n\\n     These proposals which seem to be workable, are also in line with the pro\\nnouncement of His Holiness Shrimat Anandashram Swamiji of revered memory,\\nmade during the Mahasabha (1965) at Bangalore.\\n\\n                                                                    M.

The State Government has not\\nsought to remedy the defect, so that the resources of the temples are put on a\\nsound basis to enable better maintenance of their property and administration.\\n\\n     The Government has appointed a Special Officer to begin with, for the Ban\\ngalore Revenue Division, comprising five-districts to take measures to better\\norganise the resources of the temples. The special officer has already begun a\\nsurvey of the properties of the temples.\\n\\n     There are over 1,500 temples in the Revenue Division and they have a total\\nof 66,000 acres of land. The lands in a number of cases are being cultivated\\nby tenants and in most cases, the temples do not derive any benefit from their\\nlanded property.\\n\\n     In several other cases, the lands are used to raise garden crops with no\\ncorresponding benefit to the temples. Although temple holdings are exempt from\\nthe ceiling clause under the Land Reforms law, the legislation governing payment\\nof rent, it is stated, requires to be applied to these lands in an organised way.\\n\\n     Under the new improvement scheme, the Special Officer will conduct a\\nsurvey of the temple lands and dispose them of in public auction and other\\nways. The proceeds from the sale of temple lands will be credited to the Account\\nof the Temples and the interest thereon will be set apart for the maintenance and\\nadministration of the Temples. Depending on the results, the scheme will be\\nextended to other parts of the State.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n5S\\n\\n     Second Report of the Ad-Hoc Committee appointed by the Mahasabha of\\n1965 for enquiry into the present conditions of Temples and Shrines of Saraswat\\nCommunity.\\n\\n                              Dated 18th December 1968.\\n\\n                                         Members\\n\\n          1.

This Ad-Hoc Sub-Committee, which was appointed by the Fifth Maha\\nsabha of Chitrapur Saraswats for the purpose of enquiring into the present condi\\ntions of the Temples and Shrines of our community, submitted a Report dated\\n17th December 1966 of their findings and recommendations to the Standing Com\\nmittee. This Report was considered by the Standing Committee at its meeting\\nheld at No. 2 Laburnum Road, Bombay 7, on 31st December 1966 and the\\nfollowing resolution was passed at the meeting:\\n\\n            No. 7.3. Temples and Shrines: Discussed in detail the report on\\n            the conditions of our temples and shrines submitted by the Ad-Hoc\\n            Sub-Committee appointed by the Standing Committee and resolved\\n            that the Ad-Hoc Sub-Committee do continue the work and suggest\\n            ways and means of implementing their recommendations.\\n\\n     2. The problems that face our temples and institutions today have been\\nanalysed in detail in the said Report. After being commissioned by the Stand\\ning Committee to continue the work and to suggest ways and means of imple\\nmenting its recommendations, the Sub Committee commenced further probings\\nin the matter. The main problem facing our temples and institutions in the\\nNorth and South Kanara districts is the paucity of funds. The assets possessed\\nby most of the temples are in the shape of landed properties and the Viniyogas\\nexpenses, etc., depend on the rentals received from these lands. The implemen\\ntation of the Mysore Land Reforms Act has dealt a severe blow on the income\\nof our temples. As the implementation of the Act is piece-meal, it is not yet clear\\nas to what shape the matter may finally take. The provision in that Act for the\\nfixation of fair rent will drastically reduce the existing income from the lands.\\nBesides, the rates of produce notified by the Government have been found in prac\\ntice to be far below the market rates. Recently the High Court of Mysore has\\nadmitted for enquiry, Writ Petitions from some religious institutions against the\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n59\\n\\nMysore Land Reforms Act and the Court decisions in these cases are awaited.\\nA clear picture of the position of our Temples vis-a-vis the Act can only be\\nvisualised after the disposal of these Writ Petitions. In the meanwhile, a news\\nitem from Bangalore dated November 19, 1968, appeared in the \\'HINDU \\' of\\nMadras dated November 20, 1968. According the this Press Report, the Govt,\\nof Mysore intend to sell the landed properties owned by religious Institutions in\\nthe State, and to credit the sales proceeds thereof to the Account of the Temples,\\nand the interest accruing on such amounts will be set apart for the maintenance\\nof the temples. It was also reported that the Government has already initiated\\naction in Bangalore Division in this matter and will gradually extend action to\\nother divisions. The implications of this measure of the Government on our\\ntemples and institutions are far-reaching and require a close and detailed study;\\nMore details of these proposals of the Government are needed to assess the effects\\nof these proposals. In the case of some temples, which may possess vast lands\\nwhich are at present not fully utilised and may consequently bring in little re\\nturns, this measure may have a beneficial effect. On the other hand, if the auction\\nsale of the lands realise only low prices for the lands, it will have an adverse\\neffect on the future income of the temples. In view of this fact, the Ad Hoc\\nCommittee is not in a position at present to make a definite assessment of the\\nfinancial position of our temples.\\n\\n     3. On a rough calculation, it is estimated that at the present level of prices\\nof commodities, the total shortfall in the income needed for all our temples for\\nthe purpose of proper performance of Viniyogas (including Archaks\\' salaries) is\\nRs. 1,00,000/- per year. Capitalised at 5% this comes to Rs. 32,00,000/-. An\\nadditional sum of Rs. 15,000/- is required for the annual maintenance of the\\nbuildings of the temples. Capitalised at 5%, this comes to Rs. 3,00,000/-. It\\nwould be necessary besides, to maintain a reserve of 10% of this capital as a\\nJeernodhar Fund for allotment to the temples requiring renovations in course of\\ntime. Altogether, a capital of Rs. 33,50,000/- has to be built up in order to\\nmaintain our temples.\\n\\n     4. The second important problem forcing our temples is the shortage of\\nArchaks. The problem is getting more acute day by day, as old Archaks retire,\\nand their descendents are not prepared to take their places. At present 18 tem\\nples do not have Archaks of our community, and instead there are Archaks of\\nHavik, Karad and Gowd Saraswat castes. The solution to this problem is linked\\nwith the decision on the recommendations of the Vaidik Sub-Committee. However,\\nthe Ad-Hoc Committee has got one suggestion to make. It is suggested that\\npersons who retire from employment in the cities and who are faced with the\\nproblem of spending the time usefully, may be encouraged to take up Archak-\\nship in our temples in the Kanaras. On the face of it, this suggestion may look\\nimpractical. But after all, after retirement, one turns his attention to spiritual\\nmatters and may have a subconscious hankering to go and live at their\\nancestors\\' places. Their taking up the Archakship need not be on a permanent\\nbasis, but may be for such periods as they choose and they may be replaced by\\nothers like them. Such retired persons who volunteer to go and reside in our\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n60\\n\\ntemples may be given training at Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali, for the due\\nperformance of their duties. The permanent Sub-Committees contemplated to\\nbe set up as per Para No. 5 below will have to maintain a list of such volunteers\\nand be in constant touch with them.\\n\\n     5. In the Report dated 17th December 1966 the Ad-Hoc Committee recom\\nmended the appointment of a permanent Committee by the Standing Committee for\\nlooking after the temples. It is now felt that for the sake of administrative conve\\nnience, two such Sub-Committees may be established #-- one with Head-quarters at\\nShirali to look after the temples in the North Kanara Dist., and the other with Head\\nquarters at Mangalore to look after our temples in South Kanara & Kerala. The\\nCommittees may be invested by the Standing Committee with powers to take over\\nthe control of all Saraswat temples in their jurisdiction both public and private\\nwith powers to appoint Archaks, to create funds for the management of Temples,\\netc., certain legal steps may be necessary for taking over the temples. The\\nCommittees may be empowered to take all the necessary steps.\\n\\n     In conclusion, the Ad-Hoc Committee thanks the Trustees, Adaltedars,\\nManagers and Archaks of our temples, who extended their wholehearted coope\\nration in the inquiries. The Committee will feel amply rewarded if by the Grace\\nof Lord Bhavanishanker, our Sadguru Sri Anandashram Swamiji and our\\nSadguru Sri Parijnanashram Swamiji, this Report helps the Standing Committee\\nin solving the problems of our Temples.\\n\\n      Unity of All Religions\\n\\n      All the various doctrines arising in different times and different countries\\n      lead to the same Supreme Truth like many different paths leading\\n      travellers from different places to the same city.

Secretary\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nREVIEW OF THE PROBLEMS OF VAIDIKS AND\\n                              DHARMAPRACHAR\\n\\n     The problems of Vaidiks and Dharmaprachar are interlinked and have to be\\ndealt with together. The Ad-hoc Committee appointed by the Mahasabha (1965)\\nto go into these problems had submitted its report and the Standing Committee\\nat its meeting held on 31st December, 1966 discussed the same and had by its\\nResolution No. 7.2 referred six of its recommendations to the Administration Sub\\nCommittee and one pertaining to Dharmaprachar to the Publications Sub-Com\\nmittee for necessary action. The Standing Committee has now to make the\\nfollowing observations in regard to this vexed problem :--\\n\\n     It is rather difficult to determine the exact number of Archaks/Purohits\\nrequired by our Community. That there is a great shortage of Vaidiks is an un\\ndisputed fact, though, at the Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali, at the moment, there\\nis no shortage of them. What is causing more concern is the steady dwindling\\ndown in their number. However, the following statistics are revealing:--\\n\\n      i) There are a little over a hundred Archaks/Purohits in our Community,\\n           including those at the Maths.\\n      ii) There are at least a dozen populous places like Madras, Calcutta, Delhi\\n           etc., where there is a demand for Vaidiks from the members of our\\n           Community.\\n     iii) There are about twenty Temples of our Community where a Chitrapur\\n           Saraswat Vaidik is not available.\\n\\n     To arrest the decline in the number of Archaks/Vaidiks, the following mea\\nsures call for consideration: --\\n\\n       i) Improve the service conditions at the Maths.\\n      ii) Ensure decent income, security of service, and dignity of the profession.\\n\\n     iii) Proper running of the Math Pathashala and encourage higher education\\n           to the deserving, even outside Shirali.\\n\\n     iv) Provide additional means of livelihood by giving training in astrology,\\n           medicines etc.\\n\\n      v) Award of prizes and scholarships.\\n\\n     vi) Recruitment to Vaidik profession from Grihistas.\\n\\n     vii) Dharmaprachar.\\n\\n     The Standing Committee has already taken the following steps:\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n17\\n\\n     Vaidiks at the Math : To ensure a decent income to the existing Vaidiks\\nand attract new entrants to the profession, the salary grades at Chitrapur Math\\nhave been revised twice since 1965. In addition to the cash emoluments, the staff\\nis entitled to free quarters, free food to themselves and their children, leave facili\\nties, gratuity and lately, to pension after retirement. The average income of a\\nVaidik at Shirali including all benefits in kind and bonus now comes to about\\nRs. 300/- per month. The entire salary bill would now amount to (for 1968/69)\\naround Rs. 80,000/- as against Rs. 48,500/- in 1964/65 on the eve of the last\\nMahasabha. Inclusive of food and house rent allowance in kind, the total expenses\\nincurred at the Math on staff are expected to exceed Rs. 1,14,000/-. Consider\\ning the economic conditions prevailing at Shirali, the present emoluments seem\\nto be satisfactory. Similar steps are contemplated to bring the staff at other\\nMaths in line with that of Shri Chitrapur Math at Shirali, so as to give effect to\\nthe scheme by the beginning of the next financial year of the Math. With the in\\ncrease in the Cash vantiga collection and improved agricultural returns from the\\nMath properties, the Standing Committee will not hesitate to improve the lot of\\nVaidiks in future.\\n\\n     Dharma Prachar: This alone, in the opinion of the Standing Com\\nmittee, cannot solve the problem of the Vaidiks. As His Holiness Shrimat\\nAnandashram Swamiji, of revered memory, had rightly mentioned in His inau\\ngural address to the Mahasabha (1965) \"the Vaidiks do not grow on trees\". A\\ndemand has to be created for Vaidiks, which alone could attract new entrants\\nto this profession. For this, re-awakening among the laity towards religion is\\nabsolutely essential. Unless there is an awakening towards religion, a demand\\nfor Vaidiks cannot arise. If the present drift is allowed to continue, the day\\nmay not be far off when we may have to face the problem of manning the Maths\\neven. To arrest such a drift and help a re-awakening among the laity, two steps\\nwere considered by the Standing Committee :\\n\\n      i) Publication of religious literature in a language that is largely under\\nstood.\\n\\n     ii) Dharmaprachar through Pracharaks.\\n\\nItem (i) was given effect to immediately and many publications have already been\\nmade available to the members of the Community either free or at a nominal\\ncost. As regards item (ii) the Standing Committee has not been able to imple\\nment the proposal. It was at one stage thought of to appoint two qualified\\npersons as Dharmapracharaks on decent salaries, one of whom would alterna\\ntely work as the Principal of the Math Pathashala and the other would tour\\npropagating Dharma, exchanging places every six months. This could not be\\ngiven effect to because of non-availability of suitable persons from our Com\\nmunity to undertake the work. This deserves to be pursued further and Pracha-\\ntaks from other Brahmin communities whose Sampradaya is in conformity with\\nthat of ours could be considered, if Pracharaks are not still available from our\\nCommunity.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n18\\n\\n     The Math Pathashala: The Math Pathashala has been thoroughly re\\norganized and at present nine students are undergoing the prescribed curriculum\\nfor the Vaidik profession, with free education, boarding and lodging facilities.\\nAfter education at Shirali Pathashala is over, the Math would send forth deserv\\ning students to outside place for higher education at the cost of the Math, lt\\nis distressing to note that no application has so far been received for Scholarship\\nfrom the Golden Jubilee Scholarship Fund for prosecuting higher education in\\nthe Vaidik profession. Successful students would be absorbed on the Math Staff\\nor sent to other places where Temples of our Community exist or where there\\nis a demand for Vaidiks in cities.\\n\\n     In spite of all these steps, the Standing Committee firmly feels, that unless the\\nlaity is inclined to perform the minimum nitya and naimittika ceremonies, the de\\nmand for Vaidiks can never be created and no amount of facilities or encourage\\nment given could attract new entrants to this profession, It is therefore, fervent\\nly hoped that the laity would take to the performance of the essential rituals of\\nthe Sanatana Dharma.\\n\\n     The Standing Committee therefore, appeals to the laity to come forward\\nand fill in the void created by the depleting Vaidiks by sending their intelligent\\nchildren for education and training as Vaidiks at the Math Pathashala, with an\\nassurance on its part, that, the children on successful conclusion of education and\\ntraining would be absorbed on the Math staff, if they so desire, or station them\\nat places where there is a demand for Vaidiks.\\n\\n                                                                      M. S. Pejawar,\\n                                                                     Jt. Hon. Secretary.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nREVIEW OF THE PROBLEMS OF OUR TEMPLES\\n                                  AND SHRINES\\n\\n     The First Report dated 17th December, 1966 of the Ad-hoc Committee ap\\npointed by the Mahasabha (1965) to go into the question of our Temples and\\nShrines had submitted its deeply-studied Report which has already been published\\nin two Parts in the April, 1969 and October, 1969 issues of The Chitrapur Sun\\nbeam. This report was considered and adopted by the Standing Committee at\\nits meeting held on 31st December, 1966, and by its resolution No. 7.3 the Ad-\\nhoc Committee was requested to continue the work and suggest ways and means\\nof implementing their recommendations.\\n\\n     The Second Report dated 18th December, 1968 of the Ad-hoc Committee\\nhas also appeared in the October, 1969 issue of The Chitrapur Sunbeam. This\\nReport was also considered and adopted by the Standing Committee at its meet\\ning held on 29th December, 1968, and it was further resolved as per resolution\\n7.1 to appoint a Sub-Committee to implement the recommendations made in the\\nReport.\\n\\n     The Sub-Committee\\'s Report will be considered at the next meeting of the\\nStanding Committee to be held at Madras on 28th December, 1969, and its de\\ncisions along with the Report will be placed before the Mahasabha to be held\\nat Madras on 30th and 31st December, 1969.\\n\\n     It would appear from these reports that the problem is a stupendous one,\\nboth financially and otherwise, to rehabilitate all the Temples where they exist\\nat present. The difficulties faced in this task are manifold and, in short, may be\\nsummarized as under:\\n\\n     1. Depletion in the population of our Community in the places where these\\n         Temples exist.\\n\\n     2. Want of Archaks to man these Temples.\\n\\n     3. Finance, the main problem.\\n\\n     As could be observed from the Report, many of these Temples need reno\\nvations -- some immediately. At some places except for the Priest\\'s family,\\nwhich performs the Pooja at the Temple, no other member of the Community\\nresides. About 28 Temples belong to private families, while about 57 are managed\\nby the \"Ten\".\\n\\n     Pending the Temples and Shrines Sub-Committee\\'s Report, the following ten\\ntative measures are suggested for consideration at the Mahasabha: --\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n20\\n\\n     1. Temples, which are major and are situated at places where our Community\\n        people reside, can be managed by the local residents, any financial assista\\n        nce needed for repairs or Capital Expenses may be subsid zed, as also\\n        the need of Archaks met by the Math, wherever possible.

The President therefore  suggested  that a Select  Committee\\nbe appointed  to scrutinise the proposed  amendments    and that\\nthe said Committee   be given  a reasonable   time to submit  its re\\nport and  recommendations.    The President also explained   that for\\nthis reason  the Mahasabha    would   have  to be adjourned   to a suitable\\ndate for consideration   and disposal  of unfinished  business. The\\nmeeting  appreciated  this position  and unanimously    approved   of\\nboth the suggestions,  stipulating  that the said Select  Committee\\nbe given  time till 15th March  1975 to submit  its report to the\\nStanding   Committee   and  that the adjourned   and final session  of\\nthe Mahasabha   1974 be held in Shirali, 3 or 4 days before\\nthe Rathotsav   in April 1975, the exact  date and  time to be fixed\\nand circulated  after consulting  and obtaining  approval  of His\\nHoliness.  The  President expressed   that the adjourned   session  may\\nprobably  be between   22nd and  24th April 1975.

I do not have\\nmuch   to say. I only have  to perform   the formality  of introducing\\nthe incoming   President of the Seventh   Mahasabha   of Chitrapur\\nSaraswats.\\n      Before I proceed,  however,  I would  like to clarify that the\\nMahasabha   was supposed  to be held on the 5th December,\\nbut was  postponed.  I wish  to thank  the Santa  Cruz Local Sabha\\nfor having  made  all arrangements   at such short notice and at\\ngreat inconvenience.

But our revered  Swamiji,  and my  pre\\ndecessor,  Shri Yennemadi,   seem  to have  drawn  a line for me\\nto toe --  I shall, therefore, be as brief as possible.\\n     This Mahasabha   has been convened   after a gap of five\\nyears, as is normal. During  this period, there is said to have\\nbeen  a lot of controversy   or \\'thunder  \\'. I say there has been\\nno controversy  at all. I feel that just like soothing  rain\\nafter a lot of thunder,  we should  conduct  this Mahasabha   in a\\ncool manner   that will yield beneficial  results. I am  overwhelm    \\ned by a deep  feeling  of gratitude  for being  given  this opportunity.\\n     I am  conscious  of my  shortcomings   and when  I remember\\nthe august  line of my  predecessors   in this office, from  Shri K.\\nShankarnarayan     Rao  and Shri  H. Shanker   Rao  to Shri Golikeri\\nand Shri Yennemadi,   I am  overcome   by a sense of awe.\\n      With the confidence   reposed  in me, I am  infused  with\\nenthusiasm  to do whatever  is within my  capacity  for the\\ncommunity.  All of us will strive to do our individual  utmost\\nfor our Math, Guru  and  Guruparampara.\\n     I also wish  to express  my  thanks  (with Swamiji    \\'s permis  \\nsion) to my  wife (who  is present  here) who  gave  up her country\\nand faith and helped  me  fulfil myself  as a Saraswat   and for\\nher constant  help and encouragement.\\n     We have  many  problems   facing  us during  this Mahasabha\\nawaiting  solution. But as Shri Naganand   Gulwadi   has said, it\\nis not for us to delve into the past as to who  has done  what\\n\\n                                       71\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n72\\n\\nand why. We should  instead ponder  on what  should  be done\\nhenceforth,  who  should  do what, and how  much  we  can do to\\ngether. Among  the problems,  our main  concern  is about  our\\nrevered  Swamiji    \\'s health. We may  never  realise what  pain He\\nmay  be experiencing   --  physical  or mental. Perhaps some  of\\nus might  say that He  occupies  our Peetha, and hence  has to\\nundergo  some  suffering. I do not know  how  much  suffering\\nHe  has decided  to bear --  I only know  that we should  do as\\nmuch  as is possible  in His service. He  should  never  release\\nthe hand  with which  He  leads us, nor should  we  ever draw  our\\nbands  away  from  His clasp and we never  shall do so. (loud\\napplause) At the moment,   Swamiji    \\'s health is not good  at all\\n--  blood  pressure, diabetes  (at this young  age) and the cyst\\nwhich  had to be operated  on, have  been  troubling  Him. We\\nhave  decided  to have a major  operation  performed   on Him,\\nbecause  another  cyst is threatening  to come  up. This opera \\ntion will be done  sometime   in January. For that reason, I\\npray, together  with  all of you, that our Peethastha, Paramapoojya\\nSrimat  Parijnanashram   Swamiji,  may  be granted  long life, a\\nlife free of illnesses and worry. Let us also pray that He  may\\nbe granted  physical  and mental  strength  to lead our commu    \\nnity on the proper  path.\\n\\n     Another problem   facing  us is that of our Math \\'s finances.\\nThough   the Math has run for such  a long  time, it is often beset\\nwith difficulties and deficits. We know  what  the condition  is in\\nour day-to-day businesses  --  this year and the next threaten  to\\nbe the worst  ones, both in economic   and  social areas. Some   le\\ngislation  is reported  to be on the anvil in regard  to Maths. We\\nshould  therefore  continue  to support  our Math and just as we\\nhave  ensured  our Math \\'s continuance   with generous  help so far,\\nwe  should  pledge  our support  to it always.  Even in the ensuing\\nMahasabha;   we should  not debate  on who  has done  what  and\\nwhy, but on what  should  be done  to stabilise our Math finances.\\nThis is my  humble   appeal  to all delegates.\\n\\n     Another appeal  to fellow-delegates  is that whichever   dele \\ngate might  speak  on whatever   topic, he should  not do so with  any\\nill-will towards  anyone.  All our spirit should  be conserved   for\\nwhatever   tasks are to be performed   by us. It is my  sincere  hope\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n73\\n\\nthat this Mahasabha    \\'s proceedings   will be conducted   without\\nbringing  any personal  matter  into the discussions.\\n     Another topic on which  I had decided  not to speak  is the\\nreply to Swamiji    \\'s book  which  my  predecessor   referred to in\\nhis speech. I agree that he should  definitely  submit  his reply\\nsince the book  was  in fact a letter Swamiji   addressed   to him.\\nBut I am  sure that nothing  will be done  or said or written  that\\nwill hurt either our Swamiji,  our Math or our community.   This\\nis my  sincere hope.\\n     Now,  there has been  a lot of controversy   surrounding   our\\nSwamiji.  Rumours   take wings  in our community.  But I have\\nalways  felt that just as the river Ganges,  our Ganga-Mata,  flows\\ntowards  the sea all the time  and  remains  ever pure, even  though\\ninnumerable   agents  pollute her waters, so also will our Guru  re\\nmain  unaffected   by any  talk and  it is my  prayer  to Lord Bhava \\nnishanker  that He  may, through  our Guru,  lead our community\\nto greater achievements   and higher  planes. Again, just as the\\nGanges   gives succour  to all animals  and plants along  its banks,\\nand  regardless  of how  far its waters  are defiled, flows  serenely  on \\nwards  to its union  with the sea, I am  confident  that our Swamiji\\nwill likewise  continue  to provide  His laity with guidance  and\\nspiritual succour.\\n     Just the other day, I read in The  Chitrapur   Sunbeam    of\\nApril 1970 (Serial No. 66): \"Even in respect  of the silent saint\\nwho  has retired to the woods  and accepted  a life of penance,\\nthere arise these three parties --  the friends, the indifferent  and\\nthe inimical; the greedy, the generous,  the miserly;  the cowards,\\nthe brave; the fools, the righteous;  the ugly, the beautiful. Many\\nignorant, foolish men, thriving on deceit, foist a tale on the\\nflawless  ones, even  if they be equal  in intelligence  to the worthy\\nPreceptor of the gods.\"\\n     This is my  prayer  - that we  should  conduct  this Mahasabha\\nwith all our love, devotion  and diligence  and do what  is good\\nfor our Math, Guruparampara     and  Guru.\\n     Sri Aurobindo  has said somewhere    that \"in the Krita Yuga,\\nthere is preeti:  in the Dwapara   Yuga,  there is neeti: in the Treta\\nYuga,  there is reeti; and  in the Kali Yuga,  there is nothing  but\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n74\\n\\nbhranti    \" (loud laughter). But if we are to march  forward,  we\\nhave  to combine   the first three and achieve  an \\'Integral Yoga  \\'.\\nWhen  we are marching   forward  we should  realise that we are\\nnot giving  up the past, the old beliefs or rituals but live in the\\npresent  in which  the past and  future are merged.  We do not seek\\nto defile old beliefs. We only seek to enrich  them. Let us pray\\nthat our faith and devotion  may  increase  and we may  support\\nour Guru  in His desire to enrich  our Dharma   and thereby  our\\ncommunity.   I have  no doubt  He  will lead us to spiritual progress.\\n     During  the 1969 Mahasabha,  our Swamiji   had announced\\nthat due  to some  reasons, He  was  stopping  the practice  of Pada\\npooja. It is my  earnest  desire that if we  all pray  sincerely  to Him\\nfor this boon, He  will be pleased  to grant this wish  during  this\\nMahasabha.\\n     Before I end, I wish  to read out a letter I received  from\\nthe revered  Mataji of Shri Anandashram,   Kanhangad.\\n     Let us not think of what  we  can undo  with these two  hands\\nof ours, but what  we  can do with our heads, hands  and hearts,\\nwith  our heartfelt love, devotion  and  respect  for our Math, Guru\\nand  Guruparampara.    This is my  appeal  to you.\\n     I wish  to thank, on my  behalf  and  on behalf  of my  fellow \\ndelegates,  Shri  D. D. Yennemadi    for offering  me  all his help and\\nco-operation  in carrying  out my  onerous  responsibilities  and for\\ninvesting  me  with this sacred  office with so many  encouraging\\nwords.  I also wish  to thank  the Santa  Cruz  Local Sabha   who  made\\nall arrangements   within  mere  twenty  to twenty-five  days. I am\\nsure none  of us is put to any inconvenience.   I take this oppor  \\ntunity also to thank  the volunteers  for their selfless work  and\\nflawless  arrangements.   And with that, I conclude   my  address  to\\nyou  and  seek blessings  from  Swamiji   in my  tasks ahead.\\n\\n   The Vedic gods  are only friends with whom   the seers and\\n   sages  are in communion    and the gods  move  freely among\\n   men.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nAPPENDIX \"F\"\\n              TO MAHASABHA 1974 PROCEEDINGS\\nComposition     of the New   Standing    Committee     of the Mahasabha\\n                        1974 of Chitrapur    Saraswats\\n1.

Yet the Saraswati also retains a more intimate\\ncharacter. She is not just called a river but is defined as the Divine\\nMother and Goddess. She is intimately connected with Agni, the\\nVedic sacred fire, and appears as one of his attendant\\nGoddessess or consorts (as in the Apri hymns.) The Vedic culture\\nwas a culture of the sacred fire along the sacred river of the\\nSaraswati.\\n    The Saraswati is the only river in the Rig Veda lauded in hymns\\nof its own. She is the only river that enters the Vedic pantheon\\nas a great Goddess.\\n    Saraswati like a great ocean appears with her ray, she rules\\nall inspirations (1.3.12). 4\\n    As such, she continued as the Goddess of wisdom lauded in\\nIndia today.\\n    According to the ancient Hindu law book, the Manu Samhita,\\nthe Vedic culture began and was centered in the Saraswati region,\\nwest of the Yamuna river.\\n    The land, created by the Gods, which lies between  the two\\nDivine rivers, Saraswati and Drishadvati, the sages call \\'the land\\nof the Brahmins\\'. The custom, handed down in regular succession\\nsince time immemorial among the four classes and mixed people\\nof that country, is called \\'the conduct of the Aryans\\' (MS 11.17-8).\\n     In this regard the Rig Veda says :\\n     We set you down, oh sacred fire, at the most holy place on\\nEarth, in the land of Ila, in the clear brightness of the days. On\\nthe Drishadvati, the Apaya and the Saraswati rivers, shine out\\nbrilliantly for men (lll.23.4).5\\n     This shows that the region of the Saraswati, also called \"the\\nland of Ila\", was the most sacred place on Earth, and the central\\nhomeland of the Vedic Aryans.\\n ISunbeam |             CTeD                | July1994 |E\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nYou, oh sacred fire, are the first living one for living men. The\\nGods made you as the lord of the peoples of Nahusha. They made\\nIla the teacher of men (1.31.11).6\\n    Nahusha is an important early descendant of Manu. The land\\nof Ila or Saraswati is indicated as the place where the great early\\nAryan kings and sages lived and ruled like Manu and Nahusha.\\nDivodasa, the great Aryan king and one of the earliest kings in\\nVedic mythology, is specifically said to be a gift of the Saraswati\\nriver (VI.61.1-2).\\nTHE SARASWATI   REDISCOVERED\\n     It is thus clear from the Rig Veda and the Vedic tradition that\\nthe homeland of its people is the Saraswati river. The Saraswati\\nis regarded as the most central and greatest of the rivers, and a\\nlush and fertile region. The Indus was an important site of\\nhabitation but not as central as the Saraswati. However, the\\'river\\nin India said traditionally to be the Saraswati is a minor stream in\\nthe Punjab that dries out in the desert of Rajasthan - hardly the\\ngreat stream of the Veda. This turned the great Vedic lauding of\\nthis river into something questionable or fanciful. It caused\\nnineteenth century scholars to regard the original Saraswati to be\\na small stream in western Afghanistan - the Haraquiti of the\\nPersians - where the Vedic culture was supposed to have started\\nbefore the so-called Aryan invasion of India, whose name was later\\ntransposed to this small river in India. Some  of them considered\\nthat the Saraswati, lauded as a great river, must have been\\nanother name for the Indus, though\\n     Vedic texts are quite clear about her location and difference\\nfrom it.\\n     Was there ever a time in which this Saraswati river was a great\\nriver, perhaps the largest in India, as the Vedas say? Further\\narchaeological and geographical examination of India over the\\npast few years has made a great and very important discovery\\nabout the Saraswati, one that should change our view of human\\nhistory. The minor Saraswati, one that should change our view of\\nhuman history. The minor Saraswati (now called Ghaggar),\\ntraditionally identified as the great Saraswati of the Rig Veda, was\\nI Sunbeam!

Parts of its course are quite visible from\\naerial and satellite photography. Many sites of the Indus Valley\\nculture, which flourished in the third and second millennia BC, have\\nbeen  found along its dried course showing that it was indeed an\\nimportant site of ancient Indian civilization. Hence the Saraswati\\nhas been  found to have been  a great river, perhaps the greatest\\nis India, as the Vedas say, but this takes us back to early ancient\\ntimes, to the Indus Valley culture or before - much earlier than the\\ntime period given to the Vedas by modern scholars.\\n    Another related stream also now going dry in the desert, the\\nNaiwala, corresponds to the Drishadvati, the second main river by\\nwhich Manu marked the source land of Vedic culture. In addition,\\nthe Sutlej (Shutudri of the Vedas) has also been  found to have\\nemptied into the Saraswati in ancient times. It also has a large\\ndried river bed  culminating in the Saraswati. Now it empties along\\nwith the Beas into the Indus as one of the five rivers of the Punjab.\\nIn fact, the Sutlej appears to have been  the largest of the rivers\\nin the Saraswati system. These combined flows made for an\\nimposing river, the dried river bank appearing about five miles\\nacross (as satellite photography reveals from Hanumangarh in\\nRajasthan to Marot in Pakistan).\\n    Much work in India is being done tracing the extent of this river\\nusing aerial data, land surveys and the testing of well water. It has\\nyielded information of extreme importance about the Saraswati\\nand her earlier greatness. It now has been found that the\\nSaraswati changed its course at least four times and originally\\nflowed to the sea straight through what is now the desert of\\nRajasthan. Its earlier flow joined the Luni river and entered the\\nocean at the center of the Rann of Kutch. We know fron ancient\\nGreek records that Kutch was still an insland when the Greeks\\nvisited India after the time of Alexander the Great. Kutch appears\\nas the ancient delta of the Saraswati. The most ancient course\\nof the Saraswati apparently also drained the great Yamuna river,\\nwhich first flowed west and only later flowed east into the Ganges\\nas it does today. Yet earlier in the prehistoric era the Ganges also\\n{Sunbeam |             <20}                | July 10941\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nappears to have flowed west into the Saraswati, like the Yamuna.\\nPerhaps the Vedic myth of the descent of the Ganges, which\\nappears in the literature that shifts the emphasis of Vedic culture\\naway from the Saraswati, reflects this change of course for that\\nriver. In any case, there is ample evidence that the further back\\nin time we go, the larger the Saraswati river becomes until it\\nbecomes the largest river in India just as the Vedas say, but this\\ntakes us back many thousands of years into prehistory.\\n     In later ancient times, apparently that of the Indus Valley era,\\nthe Saraswati shifted its flow to the west. It then turned south again\\naround Anupagarh in Rajasthan and entered the Arabian Sea on\\nthe west side of the Rann of Kutch, where a stream called the Nara\\nflows today. At a yet later time, definitely during the Indus era, it\\nmoved  yet more to the west, ending up in Marot in Pakistan, and\\nperhaps flowed into the Indus river from there. The last stage of\\nthe Saraswati occurred when the Sutlej shifted its banks and\\nflowed west into the Indus through the Ravi instead of south into\\nthe Saraswati. After this time the Saraswati ceased as a major river\\nand dried up in the desert (which is how it is described in later\\ntexts like the Manu Samhita and Mahabharata).\\n     Indus Valley sites, like Kalibangan, are found mainly along the\\nlater courses of the Saraswati, when it was flowing to the west\\nand already in its decline. In fact, we should rename the Indus\\nValley culture the Indus-Saraswati culture as many Hindu scholars\\nare now proposing, since the great majority of Indus sites are east\\nof the Indus and toward the Saraswati.\\n     We see that in Vedic times the Punjab, which means \\'the\\nregion of the five rivers\\', did not event exist. Another major stream\\nflowed between  the Indus and Ganges comparable in size to them.\\nThere was no seperation between  the Punjab and the Ganges\\nplain to clearly divide them but rather a continuous series of rivers\\nfrom the Indus in the west to the Ganges in the east. The\\nRajasthan desert had not yet come into being to divide these two\\nriver systems. Not surprisingly the Vedic texts speak of a land of\\nseven rivers, not one of five. The central and foremost of these\\nseven rivers is the Saraswati. This indicates that there were as\\nISunbeam j                                 | July 19941\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nmany rivers to the east of the Saraswati as to the west.\\n    The Vedic land, the land of the seven rivers, was not the\\nPunjab, though it included that region, and its central river was\\nthe Saraswati, not the Indus. The Vedic land included the course\\nof these rivers in the Punjab to the west of the central Saraswati,\\nit also included rivers to the east, and indeed a number of them\\nare mentioned in the Rig Veda as Yamuna, Ganges, and Sarayu.\\n    The Saraswati region is lauded in the Vedas as yielding milk\\nand ghee (VI 1.95.2). Saraswati is compared to a cow in her\\nrichness. The Saraswati region appears to have been a good\\npasture land, and the central region for the Vedic cult of the cow.\\nThis shows a much different climate than the present desert of\\nRajasthan.\\n     If we identify the Saraswati as the central region of the Vedic\\nAryans, the Indus Valley culture must be post-Vedic. The\\nSaraswati stopped flowing about the time of the end of the Indus\\nValley culture. Thus the end of the Vedic and that of the Indus\\nValley coincide. If the Vedic people are later than the Indus Valley\\nsites, including at Kalibangan, located on the Saraswati near its\\njoining the Drishadvati, we  find evidences of fire altars, with animal\\nsacrifices, offerings of potsherds, beads and gold, much as in the\\nVedic Brahmanical rituals.\\n    Such finds further indicate that the Indus Valley culture must\\nhave been  Vedic. The Vedic Aryans would not have attributed their\\nculture to the banks of a river that went dry before they got there.\\nThus the Vedic glorification of the Saraswati, and its tradition of\\nrelating it to this minor stream, proves the antiquity of Vedic culture,\\nthe authenticity of the region it demarcates, and its identity with\\nor precedence over the Indus Valley culture. The earlier, probably\\npre-lndus valley culture, and southern course of the Saraswati\\nappears to more appropriately mark the Vedic age, as the\\nvastness and uniqueness afforded this river in the Rig Veda makes\\nmost sense for this phase of it. Yet this takes us back much earlier\\nthan the Indus culture. Modern scientific studies indicate that the\\nSaraswati river dried up around 1800 BC, while its previous ocean\\ngoing flow ended  perhaps as early as 8000 BC.m\\njSunbeam |               C22Z>              | July 19941\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nArchaeologists first assumed the Indus Valley culture was\\ndestroyed by outside invasion (supposedly by the Vedic people).\\nNow that has been shown not to have been  the case. There is\\nno evidence of a violent end to this culture. Climate changes and\\na shifting of rivers may have done it. There is also evidence of\\nearthquakes in ancient India as in the ancient Middle East, like\\nthose that destroyed the Minoan culture. We find a progressive\\ndrying up of the region from the Sahara to the Indus in ancient\\ntimes. The Indus Valley shows evidence of having been  wetter in\\nancient times (for example, we know Palestine was also wetter).\\nThe Indian monsoon may have reached further west and gradually\\nretreated to the east, perhaps as part of the deforestation that\\nancient civilization caused. The drying up of this region would have\\ncaused the flow in the Saraswati to be reduced.\\n     When the Sutlej shifted its bank and began to flow into the\\nIndus, the Indus region would have had severe flooding and its\\nbanks may have changed, devastating the whole region. The\\nSaraswati would have dried up further. Such a change of rivers\\ncould have brought down or marked the end of an era for a culture\\ndependent  upon them.\\n     While such geological changes may at first glance appear to\\nbe far fetched ways of rationalizing traditions, they are indicated\\ngeologically and archaeologically. We  now know that the sea coast\\nof India sunk in late ancient times (as the excavations at Dwaraka\\nand along the coast of India show). In fact, this shift may have\\noccurred about the time that the Saraswati ceased to fiow, though\\nI am not certain what the connection may be. In a flat river plain\\nlike north India many floods and shifting of rivers, have been\\nrecorded through history, often causing great damage.\\n     The Saraswati river in the Vedas is thus not just a mythical\\nstream but an actual river on which the Aryans lived.\\n     Splendor is the king, all others are princes, who dwell along\\nthe Saraswati river. Like the Rain God extending with rain he\\ngrants a thousand times ten thousand cattle (VIII.21.18).7\\n     The Saraswati was the central land of the great Aryan kings\\nof north India. If we expec| to find remains of the Vedic culture\\n|Sunbeam~|                                .         | July 1994 f\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nwe should excavate the Saraswati region under the sands of the\\nRajasthan desert. The drying up of the Saraswati came at the end\\nof the Vedic age, for a people that had found it to be a great river\\nsince their earliest recollections. To place the Vedas after the\\nIndus Valley culture is a great mistake in the interpretation of\\nhistory, which hopefully we can begin to move beyond.\\n    There is thus little doubt that the main homeland of the Vedic\\npeople was this Saraswati region and that they had resided there\\nfor a long time before the hymns of the Rig Veda were finished,\\nso intimate is her place within them. As this was the central Vedic\\nhomeland, we would be inclined to see the greater Vedic land as\\nnorth India, spreading as far east as west from the Saraswati and\\nfrom sea to sea in line with the oceanic symbolism. Hence we  have\\nthe firm facts of ancient geography to support the antiquity of the\\nVedas. While our interpretation of ancient texts may be wrong, we\\ncannot deny the courses of ancient rivers. The Vedic people could\\nnot have known that this river flowed of its own accord into the\\nsea as the greatest river in India if they entered India in 1500 BC\\nwhen the river had already dried up in the desert. It took many\\nthousands of years for the Saraswati to change its course four\\ntimes and then dry up by the time of the Mahabharata. That the\\nVedas knew of this river and its greatness certainly calls into\\nquestion our entire view of human history.\\n                                                                 (concluded)\\n[Courtesy David Frawley, from his book \"Gods, Sages and Kings\",\\npublished by Motilal Banarsidas Publishers Pvt.

The apparently insurmount\\nable obstacles that looked like coming in the way of the celebrations vanished\\nin thin air and the Rathothsava revival in 1973 was nothing short of a miracle.\\nThe details of the celebrations have appeared in the April 1973 issue of the\\nChitrapur Sunbeam.\\n\\n     On 20-5-1973, the members of the Standing Committee in Bombay, the Local\\nSabhas and the Kanara Saraswat Association arranged a thanks giving function\\nand expressed their deep debt of gratitude to His Holiness for His superhuman\\nefforts in the successful termination of the Rathothsava celebrations and to that\\ndevoted band of Dharma Sevaks and Dharma Sevikas for their devoted service\\nand untiring efforts during the celebrations.\\n\\n     Unlike the annual Sadhana Saptaha which was sometimes hosted by the\\ndifferent Local Sabhas, the Rathothsava festival will from now on, be an annual\\nfeature, to be celebrated only at Shirali, and as such provision will have to be\\nmade every year in the Math\\'s budget to meet this annual expenditure. This\\nbeing the first year of revival of the Rathothsava, the preparations had to start\\nfrom almost a scratch, and hence the expenditure on this was consequently quite\\nheavy. It is not possible to say just now what is the exact amount spent. We\\nhave yet to receive from Shirali the final figures and we expect to receive the\\nsame before long.\\n\\n     The Rathothsava Sub-Committee which was formed with the object of col\\nlecting funds for this sacred cause, decided to start a permanent Rathothsava\\nFund and has fixed the target at Rs. 4 lakhs to be reached not within any spe\\ncified time, but in two or three years\\' time, so that the annual expenditure of this\\nRathothsava could be met from the interest earned on the investments of the\\nRathothsava Fund. With this object in view, it has been resolved to solicit the\\nhelp of all the Local Sabhas in the country in collecting funds to reach this target.\\nIt is our earnest request that the Local Sabhas will kindly set apart one per cent\\nout of the four per cent commission allowed to them on the Vantiga collections\\nand also collect from the Vantiga payers voluntary donations payable in conve\\nnient instalments as would enable us to reach the target in the foreseeable future.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n38\\n\\nForms for Donations to Rathothsava Capitalisation Fund are printed in October\\n1972 issue of Chitrapur Ravikiran.\\n\\n     Soliciting the kind co-operation of your Sabha.

This Mahasabha was called to\\ndiscuss only one agenda i.e. of installation of Mathadipati. There\\nwas a record attendance of the delegates numbering 114. Though\\nthe Mahasabha was called with a short notice, a large number of\\ninvitees also graced the meeting. I thank all the delegates and\\ninvitees for showing exemplary patience, extending unstinted co\\noperation and moreover helping to arrive at a unanimous resolution\\nwhich has really paved the way for achieving total unity which was\\nthe last wish of our 10th Guru Parijnanashram Swamiji. Inspite of\\ngreat provocation by gossip mongers and a charged atmosphere,\\nevery delegate and special invitee patiently went through the\\nmarathon session of deliberations for 6/7 hours. It was heartening\\nto note the total unanimity amongst the delegates with regard to the\\ncontinuation of Guruparampara.\\n   We are also very happy to see the participation of many of the\\nyounger generation members of our community in the deliberations.\\nThe participation of both the elder and younger members of the\\ncommunity gives a good indication that they have started taking\\ninterest with regard to the affairs of the Math and re-establish\\nharmony in the community.\\n   The unanimous resolution passed in the Mahasabha is produced\\nelsewhere in this issue.\\n   Though we are able to unite with regard to the issue of\\ninstallation of Mathadipati, a couple of incidents which took place,\\none during the Mahasabha and the other after the Mahasabha are\\n\\n   Chitrapur Sunbeam                                  December 1996\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nreally deplorable. I hope the people who are involved in these\\nincidents will realise that this kind of behaviour is repulsive and will\\nnot bring any dignity to them. When we are successful in achieving\\nour unity and are happy about it, we should ensure that no one is\\nhurt in the process and no one is physically harmed also. It is the\\nresponsibility of the individuals concerned as well as that of wise\\nelders of the community to offer them right guidance. I am sure that\\nLord Bhavanishanker and Guruparampara will help these people to\\nrealise their slips and good sense will prevail in future.\\n   When after such a long time we were able to sit together, discuss\\nin a relaxed atmosphere and accommodate each other\\'s views and\\nthen arrive at a decision which is in the best interests of community,\\nthe untoward behaviour from some people when they lost their\\nbalance, spoilt the whole atmosphere. Therefore I appeal to all\\npeople concerned to keep the last wish of Swamiji i.e. unity in the\\ncommunity as the ultimate and ensure that no one takes law into his\\nown hands and hurts either physically or mentally, even if some pent\\nup feelings are still inside them\\n    As the president of Mahasabha I apologise to the persons whose\\nfeelings have been hurt and request them to continue to support the\\ncause of serving the Guruparampara.\\n    Since we have clear guidance now, we must proceed to implement\\nthe decision of Mahasabha and an appeal in this regard is appearing\\nelsewhere in this issue.\\n\\n                                                               P.R.

Many persons have failed to appreciate the significance\\nof this slogan by H.H. Prijnanashram Swamiji. He meant\" do not stand still\\nbrooding over the past happenings; forget and forgive those who have done\\nharm knowingly or unknowingly. Set up new targets and strive to achieve\\nthem. Move heaven and earth to attain unity in this small community of\\nintellectuals. Our community without a Guru will be like a rudderless boat\\nwhich is bound to be smashed to smithereens against the rocks of hurdles and\\nimpediments in the stormy seas of sansar. Strive hard to seek a guru. In the face\\nof this clear stand, let us not fritter away our energies in the wrong direction\\nand do every thing possible to prevent or at least delay our search for a guru.\\n    We have received quite a few panicky enquiries regarding an open letter to\\nthe president, a letter and telegram to Sringeri Math.\\n    Charge No. 1 is that the President has not called a meeting of the laity to\\nseek their opinion and mandate to take further action on filling the vacancy of\\nthe Mathadhipati. H.H. Anandashram Swamiji of hallowed memory said at\\nthe inauguration of the Mahasabha 1947.\\n    \"The math was established for the propagation of Dharma and Devotion.\\nIt is mainly required by those who believe that the Math is necessary to secure\\nthat object and who show their active sympathy by paying Vantiga or vantiga\\ncapital in order to enable it to carry on. It is only just that the representation\\nin a Mahasabha convened to consider the activities of the Math or questions\\nof acharaand vichara should be proportionate to the number of Vantiga Payers\"\\n    In the event of the vacancy of a Mathadhipati at Shri Chitrapur Math, it is\\nthe Standing Committee who has to take all necessary steps under the\\nsupervision of the District Court. The Court of the law is above the voice of th 3\\nlaity. A question is asked in the letter whether by installation of a new\\nMathadhipati not duly ordained by our tenth Guruswami a NEW   PARAMPARA\\nwill start.\\n    Obviously the answer is No. This is not the first time that there has been\\na break in our own Guruparampara. When Shankerashram Swamiji attained\\nMaha Samadhi without appointing a Shishya, the new incumbent\\nParijnanashram Swamiji was called the THIRD Swamiji of our Guru\\nParampara. It was not a new parampara. Similarly there have been several\\ninstances in various Maths including Sringeri Math where Guru Swami\\nattained Mahasamadhi without appointing a Shishya. It was not regarded as\\na new Guru Parampara but continuation of old Guru Parampara.\\n\\n   Chitrapur Sunbeam                                                March 1996\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nThe letter further remarks \"our sacred Guru Peetha is not just a seat that any\\none can come and occupy. One who aspires for it has to prove himself worthy\\nof the same before he is installed as Mathadhipati. Can we therefore afford to\\ngive such absolute authority to some one whose credentials we do not know ?\"\\n    This is queer logic. Hitherto except for Parijnanashram Swamiji II all our\\nShishyas were taken as Bala Sanyasis. H.H. Anandashram Swamiji became the\\nMathadhipati within 10 days of his ordination. The post of a Mathadhipati is\\nnot like that of a clerk who is appointed on probation and is likely to be\\nconfirmed only after the probation period.\\n    Unity in our Community     : On all hands most of the differences between\\nthe two warring groups have been resolved. Both the groups are functioning\\nand co-ordinating in the administration of the Math both at Shirali and\\nBangalore. When H.H. Parijnanashram Swamiji out of his large heartedness\\nhas condoned all the lapses irrespective of who the perpetrators were it is not\\npaying respect to Swamiji by raking up the past.\\n    Our objective should be only one - to strive hard to be blessed with a\\nMathadhipati. Our identity as Chitrapur Saraswats is never mortgaged just by\\nseeking the blessings of Sringeri Math. The Mathadhipatis of various\\nSansthans may be invited at the time of Shishya Sweekar.\\n    It is mischievous to allege that the President has been doing things secretly\\nkeeping the Saraswat laity in darkness. All efforts made have been widely\\npublicised in the Sunbeam the official mouth piece of Sri Chitrapur Math.\\n    It was announced in Sunbeams that one candidate who was acceptable to\\nall people had to be given up on the score of yoga patta and being a non-danda\\nsanyasi.\\n    Time and again appeals have been made to one and all that any one can\\nrecommend a suitable candidate to the president bearing in mind that the\\ncandidate should be a Brahmachari, having Vedic knowledge and knowledge\\nof Sanskrit, acetic outlook and willing to take Sanyasashrama.\\n    These facts have been presented only in deference to the enquiries I have\\nbeen receiving and to allay any misgivings.\\n\\nEditor                                         %\\n\\nV.

RAJAGOPAL BHAT\\n\\n   The Plava Samvatsara has bowed out and\\nShubhakratu Samvatsara has stepped in. The first\\nday of the Samvatsara is a day of rejoicing for us. We\\ncall it Yugadi,\\n   We get a clue to the auspiciousness of Yugadi in\\na verse from    Brahma Purana. It is said therein that\\nBrahma evolved the sun and the moon first, and\\nthen, on the     pratipada   (padvo   in Konkani) of the\\nbright fortnight of    Chaitra, launched forth into the\\ncreation of the multifarious universe. Thus Yugadi\\nturns out primarily to be the day when the universe\\nsprang into existence. It marks the             adi or the\\nbeginning of the universe. So it is that we greet this\\nday with festivity and regard it as most sacred to us.\\nThe myth of creation associated with Yugadi should\\ninspire us to create a better moral and spiritual\\norder in and around ourselves. We should make it\\na day of spiritual self-renewal. Therein truly consists\\nthe significance of Yugadi.\\n   This word, Yugadi, meaning \"the beginning of\\nthe Yuga\" is intriguing. In what sense is it true to\\nsay that the first day of a Samvatsara marks the\\nbeginning of a Yuga? Our Puranas speak of four\\nYugas: Krita, Treta, Dvapara and Kali. The first three\\nYugas have gone by and we are, at the moment, in\\nthe throes of the deadly Kali Yuga. According to\\nBrahma Purana. \"Krita Yuga began on the third day\\nof the bright fortnight of Vaishakha, Treta Yuga on\\nthe ninth of the bright fortnight of      Kartika, Dvapara\\non the thirteenth of the bright fortnight of\\n\\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       29                   April 2022\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nBhadrapada       and Kali on the full-moon day of\\nMagha\". In this enumeration, there is no mention\\nof the tithi traditionally hailed as Chandramana\\nYugadi, viz. the first day (  Padvo) of the bright fortnight\\nof Chaitra. Thus, there is an apparent contradiction\\nhere : None of the four Yugas began on the day we\\ncall Yugadi and yet we regard it as Yugadi. The mist\\nof contradiction clears, however, if we interpret \"Yuga\"\\nnot in terms of specific divisions of Time, like Krita,\\nTreta, Dvapara and Kali, but as implying Time in\\ngeneral. Space and Time are correlative concepts.\\nSince the dawn of creation is associated with Yugadi,\\nit ipso facto follows that Time too started ticking\\nsince then.\\n    The word \\'Yuga\\' has many other splendid\\nconnotations in Indian philosophy. Philosophically,\\nthe four Yugas are not just the measures of Time,\\nbut also the measures of our ethical and spiritual\\nevolution. Mainly the conception of the four Yugas\\nis grounded in the proportion in which we\\n    i) possess the three Gunas:           Satva,    Rajas   and\\nTamas:\\n    ii) cultivate the four approaches to the Divine,\\nviz.. Dhyana,     Yajna,   Paricharya     (external worship)\\nand   Nama Sankirtana        (Chant of His Holy Name);\\n    iii) devote ourselves to the practice of Satyam\\n(Truth), Danam (Charity), Daya ( Compassion) and\\nDama (self-control);\\n    iv) and March ahead from the depths of inaction\\nand stupor to the full-fledged practice of religion.\\n    The following is a brief outline of these four\\npoints of view:\\n\\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         30                    April 2022\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n1.   Garuda Purana advances the following\\ndefinition:\\n   Krita Yuga : When Satva Guna that makes for an\\nabundance of moral and spiritual attributes and\\nalso the dawn of Enlightenment, permeates our\\nentire being, we are in Krita Yuga.\\n   Treta Yuga : When Rajo Guna that sets us always\\nastir with purposive activity dominates us, we are in\\nTreta Yuga. Here,     Rajas   has a dash of     Satva   in it.\\nAnd therefore, the activity that it gives rise to, is\\npurposive and altruistic.\\n   Dvapara Yuga : When Rajo Guna and Tamo Guna\\n-- the principle that conduces to physical and mental\\nstupor, sloth and ignorance -- fill our being in an\\nequal measure, we are in Dvapara Yuga. Here, activity\\nis selfish and anger, hatred, greed and the like\\nmake their inroads into our minds.\\n   Kali Yuga : When undiluted          Tamas    holds us in\\nits sway, we are in Kali Yuga. Here, the principle of\\nGood takes the backseat and it is the evil that\\nenchants us. Physical torpidity and mental stupidity\\nare the keynotes of this stage\\n   2.  Closely related to the above interpretation is\\nanother definition given in       Garuda Purana:\\n   Krita Yuga : When Dhyana or serene meditation\\nbecomes our main approach to the Supreme, we are\\nin Krita Yuga. This coincides with that stage in our\\nevolution when we are perpetually rooted in          satva  --\\nnitya satvastha, as the Gita puts it.\\n   Treta Yuga : Yajna ritual sacrifices as well as\\ndedication of all that we have and do, at the Feet of\\nthe Lord, becomes our mode of spiritual communion.\\n\\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        31                   April 2022\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nThis coincides with that stage when we are brimming\\nwith  Rajas, chastened by an undercurrent of           Satva.\\n   Dvapara Yuga :        Paricharya   or external worship\\nin all its formal details becomes the most congenial\\npathway to God. It is only when          Rajas   and   Tamas\\nare mixed up in a balanced measure that we are\\ndrawn easily to it.\\n   Kali Yuga :      Nama Sankirtana       or Chant of His\\nHoly Name becomes the only easiest and universally\\npractical means of communion with Him. When we\\nare overpowered by too much Tamas,                     Nama\\nSankirtana is the only unfailing means within our\\nreach and competence.\\n   3.  Garuda Purana supplies us with yet another\\ndefinition :\\n   Krita Yuga : Truth (        Satyam) charity (     danam),\\ncompassion (   daya) and self restraint (    dama) are the\\nfour \\'legs\\' or bases of Dharma. When these values\\nregulate our lives fully, we are in Krita Yuga.\\n   Treta Yuga :     Truth, charity and compassion still\\nanimate us, but self-restraint is wanting.\\n   Dvapara Yuga :      Charity and compassion still have\\na hold on us, but truth and self-control are at a\\ndiscount.\\n   Kali Yuga :    Only a shred of charity remains and\\nall the rest of the values go overboard. This is as\\nthough Dharma (symbolised by the Bull -- the\\nvehicle of Lord Bhavanishanker) limps along only on\\nits one leg. The present Age, full of beggars, destitutes\\nand orphans, is a colossal challenge to our sense of\\ncharity.

The more we rise upto the\\nchallenge, individually and collectively, and practise\\ncharity, the more shall we soften the rigours of Kali\\nYuga.

Aitareya Aranyaka       views the concept of our\\nYugas from another angle :\\n    Kali Yuga :    \"That is Kali when we are spiritually\\nasleep.\"   (keAefue: Me3eevees YeJeefle) We display a supreme\\nunconcern for all spiritual pursuits. Scriptures strike\\nus as so much mumbo-jumbo, and meditation, Japa\\nand the like appear to be no more than exercise in\\nfutility.\\n    Dvapara Yuga :        \"That is Dvapara when we are\\nawake.\"  (mebefpenevemleg UeHej:)At this stage, a gnawing feeling\\nof inadequacy and incompleteness about our lives\\novertakes us. We start looking out for the missing\\ningredient and wake upto the truth that when we\\ncultivate devotion to God and the Guru --the missing\\nlink in our lives -- all will be well with us.\\n    Treta Yuga :     \"That is Treta when we are not just\\nawake, but also arise.\"     (GeefEeyved $eslee YeJeefle) At this stage,\\nwe are inspired by a keen sense of purpose. We\\nreally do some piece of planning: what to read, when\\nand where to attend       satsangs, \"to what God to offer\\nour oblations\", whom to accept as our friend,\\nphilosopher and guide and so on.\\n    Krita Yuga :       \"That is Krita when we actually\\nswing into action.\"       (JeaAleb mecHeDeles (r)ejved)HereVichara\\ntranslates into      Achara.

But, if\\nAchyuta has no room in our hearts, that indeed is\\nKali Yuga  for us, even if it is Krita Yuga in time,\" says\\nGaruda Purana. Every Yugadi must inspire us to\\nusher in a   Krita Yugadi in our lives; On this day we\\nmust resolve to:\\n   1) grow rich in     Satva Guna:\\n   2) make our day-to-day actions our humble\\nofferings at His Lotus Feet, fill our daily schedule\\nwith a bit of  dhyana, a bit of ritual occasionally like\\nGana Homa, Rudraabhisheka etc., a little worship\\nand a short spell of      nama smarana:\\n   3) make truth, compassion, charity and self-\\nrestraint the moorings of our lives, and\\n   4) not merely lisp philosophy, but also practise\\nreligion.\\n   This, in fine, is the Call of Yugadi.\\n   BREAKING NEWS - MAHASABHA 2022\\n\\nShri Praveen P.Kadle, the outgoing President, has\\nbeen re-nominated as the Incoming President of\\nMahasabha 2022.

Guru Dutt, Pratibha, Shanti\\nNagar, Bangalore 1; 295 pages; Rs. 5. -- The learned author has devoted three\\nquarters of the book to a history of the Community during the years 1932 to\\n1955, -- a splendid precis of those portions of the Kanara Saraswat which relate\\nto the Math and His Holiness, social institutions, representative personalities who\\npassed away, the role of Chitrapur Saraswats in public life, and miscellaneous\\nitems of interest. In the remaining quarter of the book, he has set out what he\\nhimself would like to say to his friends. In particular, he holds that a Community\\nlike ours is an organic cultural unit standing between the family on the one hand\\naad the nation on the other, a potent instrument for co-operation with other\\nsimilar units. He believes that the vitality of Dharma lies in a synthesis of the\\nprinciple of change with that of immutability. And, finally, he tries to evaluate\\nhimself through a confession of faith, and describes the influences which have\\nmoulded his spiritual life. Although the book is not intended by him to be a\\nwork of reference, it should prove both useful and thought-provoking to all who\\nare interested in the past history or future well-being of the Community.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n49.

Bhat\\n\\n   \"On the 5th November 1995 the newly formed Dharma Prachar\\nCell of Bombay Report by G.V. Bhat Chitrapur Saraswats organised\\na \"Pilgrimage\" to Shree Durga Parameshwari Temple and\\nMahasamadhi of H.H. Swami Parijnanashram III at Karla to mark\\nthe beginning of Dharma Prachar activities for the year. There was\\nan overwhelming response from the laity for this new activity and\\nfour buses had to be chartered for this purpose. Many novel features\\nintroduced in this outing made it a very enjoyable and memorable\\nexperience.\\n   The main purpose of the visit to Karla was (1) to offer prayers\\nby all the laity of Thane Sabha at the lotus feet of Lord Bhavanishankar,\\nShree Durgaparameshwari and the Mahasamadhi of\\nH.H. Parijnanashram III to grant us our Mathadhipathi without\\nfurther delay and (2) to afford an opportunity to get all the families\\nof Thane Sabha together and to renew their contacts and to develop\\nnew contacts.\\n   Since the Sabha is widespread from Trombay to Ambernath, the\\nChartered buses had to start from different locations, viz., Chembur,\\nMulund and Thane. Each bus was identified after Lord\\nBhavanishankar and three H.H. Swamijis in the ascending order\\n(i.e., H.H. Swami Parijnanashram III, H.H. Swami Anandashram\\nand H.H. Pandurangashram) with their respective photographs\\nprominently displayed on the buses and decorated with garlands. In\\nspite of diverse and numerous pick up points, the laity were picked\\nup at their respective pick up points at the right time and without any\\nconfusion.\\n   At Karla the participants felt at home by the very good hospitaility.\\nThe administration made nice arrangements. Excellent participa\\ntion by all members was ensured by organising different programmes\\nfor different age groups. There were melodious bhavageets and\\nbhajans by all age groups till the Mangalarathi which was followed\\n\\n   Chitrapur Suri beam\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nby \"Samudayk Prarthana\" with all the laity together offering\\nprayers at the shrines for granting us our new Mathadhipathi soon.\\nAfter prasad bhojan and distribution of prasad to those who\\nperformed sevas, the President of the Sabha briefed the members the\\nactivities planned by the Sabha for the year. Thereafter self intro\\nduction by head of the families took place which helped to get to\\nknow each other well. The children were kept busy in the adjoining\\nshamiana with tailor-made programme, e.g., self Introduction, story\\ntelling, games, etc., with prizes to the winners (Master Mangesh\\nAlekal, Master Rashikesh Mavinkurve, and Miss Shibani Ullal)\\nand all the participants as well. There was to have been a quiz\\nprogramme to generate interest in the history of Saraswat commu\\nnity, our rich spiritual heritage and families of Thane Sabha which\\ncould not be held for want of time.\\n   The party did \"AU  RE   VOIR\" to Karla after a cup of refreshing\\ntea at 4.30 p.m. The enthusiasm was so great that even while\\nreturning the singing of devotional songs continued in thebuses and\\nat dusk Deepanamaskar was observed.\\n   The programme was liked so much by the members that they\\nrequested for more of such activities and offered their help.\\nDharmaprachar Cell with Shri S.S. Nirody as Dharmaprachar\\nSecretary has chalked out a number of interesting programmes\\nwhich will be unfolded depending on the response from the laity.\\n   A \"Geeta Chanting Competition\" for the age group of 5 to 20\\nyears has been planned in January 1996.\\n\\n   ChitrapurSimbeam              March 1996\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'"

The\\nmilestones in the history of the institution have been indicated and seven important\\ndocuments bearing on the history from 1720 to 1913 have been reproduced in the\\nShrimat Anandashram Ordination Jubilee Souvenir. A  connected history in Eng\\nlish was   first brought together in 1938 in A Chitrapur Saraswat Miscellany. The\\nlatest attempt  is the Shri-Chitrapura-Guruparampara-Charitra, an extensive, in\\nstructive and inspiring volume in simple Marathi verse, published in 1955.\\n\\n     The earlier documents make it clear that the then representatives of the Com  \\nmunity desired the Guru  not only to be the head of the Math  but also to regulate\\nthe achar and vichar of the Community,  and further, that they undertook not only\\nto obey  his orders and be subject to his disciplinary control, but also to provide the\\nfinance required from time to time. As  it happened, however, the institution had\\nto face several crises arising out  of these obligations, but, by the grace of God, it\\nsucceeded in overcoming them all.\\n\\n     The beginnings of the Math  were very humble. The Community  was  then\\nmostly in the Kanaras.  The Guru  used to go about   visiting the houses of disciples\\nand ministering to their spiritual needs. Buildings, permanent   sevas, property   and\\nregular festivals were later accretions which grew in course of time.\\n\\n     The Present Regime. -- For the purposes   of the present narrative, it will\\nsuffice to deal with the regime of the present Guru  which is at once the most  im\\nportant   and the most  eventful in the history of the institution. From  the point of\\nview of the relations between the Math  and the Community,  the 41 years  divide\\nthemselves into three well-marked periods as follows: --\\n      (1)  1915-26, years  of comparative  estrangement and helplessness which one\\n          shudders to think of at present;\\n      (2)  1927-31, years of growing contact and sympathetic understanding,\\n          heralded by the first big tour  of His Holiness to Bombay,   Rishikesh, etc;\\n          and\\n      (3)  1932-56, years  of active cooperation and solid improvement, of which the\\n          foundations were well and truly laid by the first representative Mahasabha\\n          in 1932 and the edifice has been carefully reared all these 24 years  by the\\n          Standing Committee with the inestimable blessings of His Holiness and\\n          the valued help of the laity in general and of Local Sabhas in particular.\\n\\n      Solid Improvement. -- It was   during the last of these three periods that the\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n15\\n\\ncauses  of estrangement were removed and the widening chasm was   bridged; the laity\\nwas   actively associated with the administration; a Reconstruction Fund of a little\\nover  Rs. 1 lakh was   collected, debt which had mounted  up  to over  Rs. 79,000 was\\ncleared, and urgent reconstruction of tottering buildings was   carried out; radical\\nretrenchment was   effected through the earlier suspension  and later abolition of the\\nCar  Festival which, in the language of His Holiness, looked like a gigantic wave\\nwhich threatened to engulf the Math; budgetary equilibrium was  restored; the\\nmiserably low emoluments of the staff were appreciably raised; the financial\\nposition was   stabilised by augmenting and creating a variety of capital funds;\\nameliorative measures  were adopted by reducing the vantiga rate, by exempting\\nlower income groups  from vantiga payment    and by creating a Priests' Subsidy Fund\\nand a Social Amelioration Fund; accounts  were duly maintained and audited; four\\nstudents were trained at Banaras,    and the Pathashala at the Math  was   reorganised;\\nthe periodical tours  of His Holiness, which had been abeyance for more  than a\\nquarter   of a century, were re-started over  practically the length and breadth of the\\nland in view of the continuing phenomenal exodus of our  population from the\\nKanaras    to places outside; hundreds of discourses were delivered by His Holiness\\nhimself at different places, and numerous    contacts established; the Silver Jubilee of\\nthe ordination of His Holiness was   celebrated, and an  annual  Sadhana Week, less\\nexpensive, less laborious and of greater spiritual benefit to the Community\\nthan the Car  Festival was  instituted; a nice building was  purchased at\\nBangalore for the use of His Holiness; and wide publicity was   given throughout to\\nMath  affairs, particularly to the movements   of His Holiness, his discourses, the\\nproceedings of Mahasabhas    and the Standing Committee, and the annual  accounts,\\nand a quarterly  magazine started in 1954 for the purpose.\\n\\n     The Constitutions. --   The Constitutions of Local Sabhas and Committees, and\\nof the Mahasabha,   its Standing Committee and Sub-Committees, as  they stand at\\npresent, have been published in the Chitrapur Sunbeam for January    1956.\\n\\n      Trusts Legislation and After. -- The Mahasabha    of 1950 held and His Holi\\nness then agreed, that the position of the trustee of a Math  under the Bombay\\nPublic Trusts  legislation was  inconsistent with the deep reverence in which the\\nspiritual head of a Math  is held by his disciples, and that, while continuing to re\\nmain the spiritual head of the Community   and the Math, His Holiness might, in\\nthe circumstances, devote himself to spiritual ministration, instruction and worship,\\nand divest himself completely of the administration of the Math  and cease to act\\nas  its trustee, the administration being vested in a Board  of Trustees. Action in the\\nmatter  was,  however, deferred pending a clarification of the exact legal position.\\nThe Mahasabha    of 1955 has, again with the concurrence of His Holiness, ap \\npointed an  expert committee to re-examine the whole position and authorised the\\nStanding Committee to take necessary  action in the light of the expert committee's\\n recommendations.\\n\\n      Shishya-Sweekar. -- An  event of unusual  interest is in the offing: it is the\\nShishya-Sweekar about   which an  assurance   has been given by His Holiness, though\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n16\\n\\nthe date and other details have to be settled by him. The Mahasabha    of 1955 has\\ninvited all members  of the Community   to participate in the auspicious event by\\ncontributing liberally to the fund already started by the Standing Committee for the\\npurpose.\\n\\n     Other matters  of importance which are engaging attention are the position of\\nvaidiks who, for economic reasons,  have been rapidly dwindling in numbers; and\\nthe gap in revenue threatened by Bombay     's drastic tenancy legislation.\\n\\n     Publicity and the Sunbeam. --   Publicity was   given to Math  affairs from 1932\\nthrough the hospitable pages of the Kanara Saraswat. When, however, the matter\\nwas   considerable, it was   published in the form of Math Supplements to that\\nmagazine at the Math 's expense. But  this arrangement  did not suit numerous\\nvantiga-payers  who  were not members of the Kanara   Saraswat    Association, and\\nwho  desired that they should, in fairness, be supplied with copies of all matter  pub \\nlished by the Standing Committee. Accordingly, Math  Supplements ceased to be\\nissued, and printed Circulars were sent out  from time to time to all vantiga-payers.\\nIn January    1954, a further step in publicity was  taken by starting a quarterly\\nmagazine on behalf of the Math, namely, the Chitrapur Sunbeam. It is intended\\nfor the propagation  of Dharma   and the publication of Math  accounts, news  and\\nnotes. It contains discourses and articles by His Holiness whenever these are\\navailable. The January    issue of each year  from 1955 also includes a very  useful\\nDirectory of all vantiga-payers, and copies of all issues are supplied free to them.\\nFacts and figures alike indicates that this new  landmark in the history of the Math\\nhas provided a much-needed stimulus, produced a definite awakening, and sub \\nstantially enhanced the practical utility of the institution as  the Community   's most\\nvital connecting link.\\n\"),\n",

V. Koppikar, B.A. (Hons.)\\n\\n     We, the followers and disciples of the Chitrapur Math, our Spiritual Home,\\nhappen to be the votaries of Lord Shree Bhavanishankar who is our Aradhya-\\nDaivata or Ishta-Deva, from the time of our Revered Adya-Guru Shree Paridna-\\nnashrama Swamiji of very sacred memory; and, consequently, propitiating\\nRUDRA has been our favourite devotional practice which has continued from\\ngeneration to generation in the long history of the Math as well as of the Chitrapur\\nSaraswat Community at large.\\n     Incidentally, it may be noted that we belong to the ADVAITA-FAITH and\\nfollow the Bhagavata Sampradaya, which does not observe any distinction between\\n\"SHIVA\" and \"VISHNU\", or any other Deity, because God, the Supreme Being,\\nis Dwandwateeta and manifests Himself in many forms according as necessity\\narises, for the Creation (Srshti), Protection (Sthiti) and Destruction (Laya) of the\\nUniverse. Rudra is one such form; and though He is generally associated with\\nthe last aspect. His contribution towards the first two is impressive enough to\\nentitle Him to claim our devotion and to be propitiated for the welfare and well\\nbeing of the world.\\n     The history of Rudra-Aradhana has its roots in the Vedic times, when\\nSacrifices (Yadna) were prevalent, and Suktas were composed and were in con\\nstant use for the Yadna-Karyas. Of these, three are important, viz. (1) PURUSHA-\\nSUKTA, recited in prayer to the Virata-Purusha, (2) PAVAMANA-SUKTA,\\nwhen crushing the Soma-plant for extracting juice, and (3) RUDRANUVAKA,\\nchanted after the erection (Chyayana) of the Vedika, i.e. the predestal of bricks\\nmade for keeping the Fire for offerings. These Suktas were primarily used as\\nMantras meant for the peformance of a Sacrifice. When,  however, the practice\\nof Shrouta-Yadnas was on the decline, and Pratikopasana i.e. image-worship be\\ncame popular these very Suktas came to be chanted for Abhisheka. Homa, etc.\\nin praise of the Deities worshipped.\\n     Rudra-Aradhana is performed for the propitiation of Rudra or Lord Shankar.\\nThe origin of this Anushtthana can be traced in the Vedas wherein it is described\\nand prescribed as one of the Vedic Anushtthanas. The Kalpa-Sutrakaras, like\\nBoudhayana have laid down the mode and procedure for this Anushtthana\\nThere is also to be found a minute and detailed description of the Anushtthana\\nin the Vedas which are \"APOURUSHEYA\", i.e. Self-emanated or Swayambhu,\\n(having manifested themselves as \"NISHWASA BHOOTA\", being a part of the\\nbreathing of the Supreme being, the PARAMATMAN)  and the importance\\nattached to this Anushttahana is in the nature of Veda-Pramanya, and therefore\\nobligatory to be followed by the followers of the Vedic religion.\\n     There is a strong Puranic support for this propitiation. In the Bhagavata Purana\\n-- in Skanda VIII-vii-18/43 -- we read that at the time of the Samudra-Manthana\\nwhen the Devas and the A suras were engaged in churning the Ksheerasagara\\n(Milk Ocean) in quest of Amrit (Nector) the Halahala or Kalakoota. poison ap\\npeared first, and the effect of this was so dreadful that the whole world was on\\nthe point of being burnt, and unless somebody came forth to consume it, it was\\nfound, the Universe would be destroyed. At this critical moment both the Devas\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n6\\n\\nand the A suras prayed to Lord Shiva or Rudra, One of the Trinities, to come to\\ntheir rescue. In response to their prayer, He immediately appeared on the scene\\nand swallowed the whole of it by squeezing the same in the cavity of His palm\\n(sk. VIII-vii-42), and in doing so He said to His Divine Consert Bhavani that\\n\"Security must be vouchsafed by me to the whole Creation and preserve the life\\nof all beings; for to protect the afflicted is the primary concern of a Great One\".\\nHe says, (Sk. VIII-vii-37/40):-\\n\\n     This shows that Rudra is the \"Saviour and Protector\" of the whole Creation.\\nHence Rudra-Aradhana is prescribed as an antidote to all evil. It may be noted\\nin this context that the swallowed poison ultimately settled down in His throat\\nwhich turned blue and is looked upon as one of His ornaments. He is significantly\\ncalled \\'\\'NEELAKANTHA  \".\\n     Rudranuvaka consists of Two parts; \"NAMAKA\"  and \"CHAMAKA\"  --\\n\"Namaste Rudra Manyava, etc.\" and \"Vajaschame\" etc. respectively. The Vedic\\nnames for these are \"Shata-Rudriya\" and \"Vasordhara\", and each of these con\\ntains Eleven divisions called \\'Vargas\\'. The First part viz. \"Namaka\" offers Salu\\ntations to the Lord, and the Second, viz. \"Chamaka\" expresses certain Cravings\\nof the worshipper. Rudra is supposed to have disclosed two aspects -- Fierce\\n(Ghoratanuj and Calm (Aghoratanu) as indicated (Sk. VIII-vii-29) in the Bhagawata,\\nSadyojata, Vamadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusha and Ishana are some of his forms. The\\nSalutations are intended to pacify Him in the Fierce Form of Rudra, and pros\\ntrations are the only means for this purpose, as is mentioned in Shata-Rudriya.\\nThe Vasordhara part is full of Cravings for the benefit of mankind in this world\\nand hereafter and tends to \"Naishkarmya-Siddhi\" as opposed to \"Kamya-Siddhi\".\\n     Rudra-Aradhana is performed in different prescribed degrees; Ekadasha-\\nRudra, wherein Rudranuvaka is recited Eleven times, pouring on the Linga (the\\nSymbol representing Rudra), Milk, Curds, Ghee. Honey, Sugar-cane juice. Mango\\njuice, Jaggary solution followed by Cocoanut water or Pure water, to the ac\\ncompaniment of the recital of Rudranuvaka. Eleven times of the Ekadasha-Rudra\\nwill be a Laghu-Rudra. This can be raised by appropriate multiplication to\\nMaha-Rudra, and Ati-Rudra. This Anushtthana properly performed washes off\\nall the sins of the devotee and brings him the choicest blessings of Lord Shree\\nBhavanishankar.\\n          May Lord Rudra bless one and all.\\n          Sarve cha Sukhinah santu;\\n          Sarve Bhadrani pashyantu,\\n          Sarve santu Niramayah,\\n          Ma Kaschit Dukhhamapnuyat.\\n                                            --OM\\n                              Shantih, Shantih, Shantih.\\n------- PAGE END -------'),\n",

But all these activities were\\nconfined to Kanara where most of our people lived in those days.\\n\\n        It was in the time of the present Guru that movements of population from Kanara\\ntook place on a large scale, and he personally undertook the work of delivering discourses.\\nHe has already delivered literally hundreds of them, mainly in Konkani, but occasionally\\nin Kannada, Marathi and Hindi. English summaries of 31 of these were published at\\ndifferent times in Math Supplements to the Kanara Saraswat and later brought together\\nand republished in book form in the Shrimat Anandashram Ordination Jubilee Souvenir\\npublished in 1941. The Sunbeam will hereafter play its part in the broadcasting of such\\ndiscourses. There will be other useful matter as well to the extent which space permits.\\nAnd brethren, sisters and children alike will find something of interest to them.\\n\\n        In this work, both language and script present difficulties without number. A\\nlarge section of the Community cannot read the Nagari script, another cannot read\\nKannada, and yet another English. To add to the trouble, the spelling of Konkani, which\\nhas been mostly spoken and seldom written so far, is anything but settled. But what are\\ndifficulties for if they are not to be surmounted ? Experience will guide.\\n\\n        Lastly, a word about this editor. He is a singular person. And, being singular,\\nhe cannot be plural. So the editorial \"we\" is out of the question for him. Secondly,\\nthough he may be somewhat keen on serving the Math and the Guru, he has not, of late,\\nbeen growing exactly younger with the years. And thirdly, from the point of view of true\\nknowledge and experience, he is a poojya--not a worshipful figure by any means, but a\\ncomplete cipher. So, with folded hands as ever, he bows down to one and all and craves\\ntheir blessings.\\n\\n                Salutations on every side to Thee, O All!\\n                                       * Bhagavad-Gita *\\n------- PAGE END -------'),\n",

A small pooja and prayer preceded this event. This marked\\nthe completion of Projects, Phase I -\"Vision beyond 2000\" as it was called.\\n\\nTechnical evaluation of the existing accommodation in the Math premises\\nhad indicated that a major overhaul of the structure would be required.\\nMoreover, as proposed in phase II, the Parikrama would be widened, a\\nlot of construction and demolition work would have to be done inside,\\ncausing a lot of disturbance and inconvenience to His Holiness.

At a grand function, the Jagadguru blessed the projects\\nwhile emphasising the close and affectionate bond between the Shringeri\\nand Chitrapur Math.\\n\\nThe Dhyanmandir was the second of the three projects taken up in\\nDevelopment Project Phase I (The others being the Goshala, and Acharya\\nNivas).\\n\\nThe 7500 sq. ft. structure blends aesthetically with the existing frontage\\nof the Math, and replaces the earlier \\'Major Ugran\\' to the North-East of the\\nMath. This \\'Dhyan Mandir complex\\' houses the offices of the Math on the\\nground floor, a residential area for visiting VVIPs (Spiritual Heads) on the\\nfirst and a spacious Meditation Hall on the second floor.The VVIP complex\\n(1st floor) has an air-conditioned personal room with attendant facilities,\\na big interview room, and adequate pantry and toilet facilities.\\n\\nThe Meditation Hall has a stage with two ante rooms on either side, and\\na large seating area. Presently adequate windows  and fans make up for\\nthe ventilation, but provision for air-conditioning, if required in future, has\\nalso been made. An elevator is provided for the needy. The overall\\nambience is conducive to the purpose for which it is built. Conducted\\nmeditation sessions were started in the Dhyan Mandir by His Holiness\\nSadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji from 6th June 2002 onwards. During\\nChaturmas, Rathotsava etc, the Hall is also used for Bhavanishankar\\nPooja.\\n\\nIt is Swamiji\\'s wish that visitors to the Math should spend more of their\\ntime in meditation and prayer.\\n\\nThe office area on the ground floor is roomy, with good ventilation and\\nadequate storage space for records. With increase in administrative staff,\\ncomputers etc, this was urgently needed. His Holiness Sadyojat\\nShankarashram Swamiji inaugurated the office on 1st March 2002.\\n\\nThe Complex has been completed at an overall cost of about Rs. 68.73\\nlakhs (furniture & fixtures, interiors, airconditioning, electrical installations)\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nthe major portion coming from a handsome donation of Rs. 35 lakhs from\\nDr. Vinita Nirody of Ireland and Rs. 8 lakhs from the Kanara Saraswat\\nAssociation Mumbai and generous donations from numerous well-wishers.\\nAdarsh Builders & Contractors of Mangalore took about 20 months for\\ncompletion of this job, architecturally designed by Shri Sudhir Nadkarni,\\nsupervised by Shri.

Built in a record time of 5 weeks,  at a\\ncost of Rs. 17 lakhs, this system is capable of drawing water from 4\\nexisting and one new  well into large underground storage tanks. The\\nfiltration system involves alum treatment and filtration, carbon treatment,\\nand controlled Chlorination. The filtered water is again stored in large\\nunderground storage tanks ready to be pumped to 13 storage tanks in the\\nMath and as far as Panchavati and Anandashraya, ensuring continuos\\nsupply of clean, safe, water.\\n\\nRadiant Energy Systems Pvt.

The 1.1 lakh litre capacity\\nRCC   water tank, vital for the system, was constructed by Prakruti Engineers\\nin a record time, and enabled the inauguration of the project by\\nSwamiji on 21st April 2002, thereby ensuring that from this Rathotsava\\nonwards, no shortage of safe water will ever be felt at the Math and\\nAnandashraya.\\n\\nA further extension of this project (Phase II, completion by Oct. 2002), will\\nensure filtered, safe drinking water to the entire Chitrapur Village.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\nPHASE  II\\nWith the Phase -1 happily completed, the second stage of Math Renovation,\\nReconstruction, Beautification has begun.\\n\\nIn order of priority, the following is being attended to :\\n1.  Renovation  of existing guest house opposite the Sarovar: (Guest\\nHouse II) This work, planned and designed by Sudhir Nadkarni, was\\ntaken up on top priority, and completed before Rathotsava 2003 by Pinakin\\nConstructions. To keep in tune with the master plan, expectations and\\nneeds of the devotees today, the guest house has been modified to have\\nan enclosed bathroom-western toilet in each of the rooms, making them\\nself sufficient and independent. The entry to the guest house is reoriented,\\nso that it is on the side of the new  guest house complex coming up (not\\nthe sarovar side) Glazed tiling of passages, floors and bathrooms,\\nstaircases has given the guest house a very pleasant image.\\n\\nThe \\'VIP Guest house\\', (now, Guest House I) earlier a dormitory\\narrangement, has also been divided into two separate rooms.\\n\\nThe total cost came to Rs. 15.54 lakhs.\\n\\n2.

Hattiangdi\\n\\n     This is the Golden Jubilee year of the ordination of our Guru, H. H. Shrimat\\nAnandashram Swami. During the past half-century, various members of the staff\\nat Shri Chitrapur Math have served Him well. Some of them are no more today\\nto pay homage to their beloved Master. It behoves us therefore to make them\\nrelive in our memory by remembering them on this auspicious occasion.\\n\\n     Among the departed souls, the most faithful were Kaikini Subraya Bhat,\\nHaridas Ramachandra Bhat, Shukla Mangesh Bhat, Shanthamurthappa M. Stha\\nlekar, Baindur Shankar Bhat, Shukla Rukma Bai, Vittal Subraya Bhat and Shukla\\nLaxman Bhat.\\n\\nKaikini Subraya Bhat (d. Shirali, 14 November 1927). According to tradition,\\nour first Guru was accompanied by two Saraswats, Phatba and Dhulba, who took\\nup the profession of priests. They were renamed as Rama and Krishna, and\\nmarried to girls of our Community. Rama had no progeny. The descendants\\nof Krishna followed the priestly vocation at Gokarn, Kaikini, Mallapur and\\nShirali. In course of time, they adopted the names of the villages where they had\\nsettled as their surnames. Kaikini Subraya Bhat belonged to one of these families\\nand his lineage thus extends to a companion of our Adi Guru.\\n\\n     Subraya Bhat\\'s date of birth is not available. He was a sahapati of H. H.\\nShrimat Pandurangashram Swami, and studied Vyakarana, the Shastras, the Vedas\\nand the Upanishads. These were not his only forte. He was an eminent astro\\nloger and had also mastered the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Thus, he was\\na scholar, an astrologer and a Vaidya rolled into one.\\n\\n     The important role played by Subraya Bhat in the Shishya Sweekar of 1915\\nis wellknown. In the difficult years immediately following H. H. Shrimat Anand\\nashram Swami\\'s accession as Guru, Subraya Bhat was a tower of strength to his\\nyoung Master and very well did he guide Him in subjects such as Anushthana-\\npaddhati, Raghuvansa and Shiksha-bhaga.\\n\\n     Subraya Bhat was the first person to write a complete history of our Math\\nand Guruparampara. He contemplated publishing a book entitled The  History,\\nof Shri Chitrapur   Math, but passed away before the text could be edited. It is\\nstill in manuscript form. It may be mentioned that some of our later chroniclers\\nhave referred to this manuscript from time to time.\\n\\n     Subraya Bhat was truly the last of a learned class of priests, and a pride of\\nthe Community. In his death, the Community and the Math lost a learned and\\npious man, and His Holiness a devoted friend and guide.\\n\\nHaridas Ramachandra Bhat (b. Shirali, 26 September 1868; d. Shirali, 17 January\\n1929) was H. H. Shrimat Anandashram Swami\\'s father in His purvashram. An\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n9\\n\\nextremely pious Brahmin, he was eminent as a scholar in Sanskrit Sahitya and\\nNyaya, and as a musician and kirtankar.\\n\\n     According to the tradition established at the Haridas Math, he used to per\\nform the daily rituals at that Math and also observe the Krishna Jayanti vrata.\\nHe would worship Lord Krishna with genuine devotion and sing bhajans with a\\nrapturous melody. He loved children. And, as he narrated Puranic stories to\\nthem, his voice use to choke with emotion and tears would course down his cheeks.\\nIndeed, Haridas Ramachandra firmly believed that the Lord pervaded all the five\\nsenses.\\n\\n     He was also an ardent devotee of H. H. Shrimat Pandurangashram Swami,\\nand used to visit Shri Chitrapur Math daily to be at the feet of His Holiness\\nwhom he revered and adored with all humility and devotion. His deep faith in\\nthe Sadguru enabled him to attain self-realization.\\n\\n     Like Kaikini Subraya Bhat, Haridas Ramachandra was one of H. H. Shrimat\\nAnandashram Swami\\'s earliest tutors. He taught Kiratarjuniya, Dipika, Nila-\\nkanthi, Nyaya-bodhini, Tarka-samgraha and Viveka Chudamani. Before Haridas\\nRamachandra passed away, he had the profound satisfaction of hearing the\\nBrahma-Sutra read out and explained by his erstwhile son.\\n\\nShukla Mangesh Bhat (b. Shirali, 1867; d. Shirali, 31 October 1933) was brought\\nup at Murdeshwar and Manki by his uncles, Hakkal Ramappayya and Manki\\nSubrao. He received his early education at these places, and returned to Shirali\\nwhere he studied Sanskrit and the Shastras.\\n\\n     When he was only 22 years of age, Mangesh Bhat had the good fortune of\\nbeing appointed Manegar  of Shri Chitrapur Math during the regime of H. H.\\nShrimat Pandurangashram Swami. He enjoyed His full confidence. But, after\\nHis Holiness attained Mahasamadhi, Mangesh Bhat appeared to lose his bearings\\nand his management of the Math was not free from criticism. Nevertheless, it\\nremains to his credit that, when he found the Community was eager to place the\\nMath administration on a sound footing, he was prudent enough to resign the\\npositions of Manegar  and Manager of the Math, the former office having been\\nheld by him for 43 years.\\n\\n     Mangesh Bhat was H. H. Shrimat Anandashram Swami\\'s maternal uncle in\\nHis purvashram. By nature, he was affectionate and amiable, religious and\\ncharitable. This is borne out by the fact that, when he passed away, his funeral\\nwas attended by people of all communities, and the long procession which follow\\ned the bier was unique within living memory. Even the schools and shops in\\nShirali village were closed as a mark of respect.\\n\\nShanthamurthappa M. Sthalekar (d. Shirali, 1 March 1936) joined the staff of\\nShri Chitrapur Math many years ago as a Shenai (=writer). He was popularly\\nknown as Shenai--Murthimam, and his handwriting was indeed beautiful. He\\nused to accompany H. H. Shrimat Pandurangashram Swami and, later, H. H.\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n10\\n\\nShrimat Anandashram Swami, on tours. He also did commendable work during\\nthe reconstruction of the Samadhi Maths at Mallapur and Gokarn.\\n\\n     Shenai - Murthimam was of a very pious nature. His calm and dignified\\nface, simple habits, polite manners, and amazing zeal for work commanded res\\npect from all. His entire life was spent in the service of the Math and thus in\\nthe service of the Community.\\n\\nBaindur Shankar Bhat (b. 1879; d. Shirali, 7 October 1958) was an astrologer and\\nperhaps the oldest member of the Math staff, having had the unique service re\\ncord of about six decades.\\n\\n     Shankar Bhat was a boy when he joined Shri Chitrapur Math during the\\nregime of H. H. Shrimat Pandurangashram Swami. Besides studying various\\nreligious books, he showed keen interest in astrology. As the years went by, his\\nproficiency in the latter increased, and he developed into an astrologer of eminence.\\n\\n     Shankar Bhat was one of the lucky men who witnessed the Shishya Sweekar\\nof 1915. His crowning moment was when H. H. Shrimat Anandashram Swami\\nconsulted him regarding the choice of a Shishya. After carefully studying the\\nhoroscopes of several candidates, he gave his verdict--Ravindra Shankernarayan\\nShukla. Incidentally, his opinion was upheld by other astrologers who were\\nconsulted later.\\n\\n     Such was Shankar Bhat\\'s astrological acumen that he knew precisely when\\nhe would be called away. He was confined to bed for a few days but was\\nconscious to the last. On 7 October 1958, he took Bhagirathi and asked his\\nnephew (his wife had died several years earlier, and they had no issues) to remove\\nhim from the cot and lay him down on the floor. A few minutes later, this\\nveteran worker and ardent devotee of the Guru passed away.\\n\\nSmt. Shukla Rukma Bai Ramkrishna Bhat (b. Shirali, January 1888; d. Shirali, 1\\nDecember 1960), known endearingly as Rukma Bai of Kachery   Bidar, had the\\nrare privilege of constantly and silently serving three of our revered Swamis. She\\nused to prepare Bhiksha for Them. Steadfast and devoted in her service, she\\nearned the respect of the entire Community. She passed away after a protracted\\nillness which she bore patiently.\\n\\nVittal Subraya Bhat (b. Vittal, December 1899; d. Mangalore, 1 July 1961) hailed\\nfrom a family of Archaks attached to the Shrimat Ananteshwar Temple, Vittal.\\nAfter primary schooling at Vittal, he was sent to Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali,\\nin June 1916 for training as a Vaidik. There, he became one of H. H. Shrimat\\nAnandashram Swami\\'s two sahapatis, the other one being Shukla Laxman Bhat.\\nThey took lessons in Kavya, Vyakarana, Vedanta, etc from Swami Krishnacharya\\nSaraswati. Vasa Annappa Shastri and other tutors.\\n\\n     Actively interested in the propagation of knowledge, Subraya Bhat was\\nmainly instrumental in the founding of the Shrimat Anandashram Library and\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n11\\n\\nFree Reading Room at Shirali, and the Saraswat Vidyarthi Nilaya at Vittal. He\\nwas also a member of the Chitrapur Saraswat Vaidiks\\' Conference.\\n\\n     Subraya Bhat was endowed with a keen intellect and sharp memory. Two\\nexamples of his scholastic achievements deserve special mention: in the late\\ntwenties, he was awarded the first prize for his dissertation in Kannada, \"A\\nSynopsis of the Five Cults including Advaita\": in 1935, he was one of the invited\\nspeakers to the Third Conference of Religions held at Dharmasthal.\\n\\n     The Community owes a deep debt of gratitude to Subraya Bhat for taking\\ndown meticulous notes of discourses delivered by H. H. Shrimat Anandashram\\nSwami at various places. These notes in Kannada were later translated into Eng\\nlish by Mr H. Shankar Rau and published at different times in The  Kanara   Sara \\nswat; the English translations were reprinted in The Shrimat  Anandashram\\nOrdination   Jubilee  Souvenir.\\n\\n     After his father\\'s demise, Subraya Bhat was obliged to return to Vittal and\\nsettle down there as the temple priest. Although he was there in the flesh, his\\nspirit was present at Shirali. He played a major role in formulating the appro\\npriate ceremonies in celebration of H. H. Shrimat Anandashram Swami\\'s 60th\\nBirthday. He was eager to be present at Shirali on this unique occasion, and\\nremain there to spend the evening of his life at his Master\\'s feet. But Destiny\\nwilled otherwise and he breathed his last at Mangalore on 1 July 1961 after a brief\\nillness.\\n\\nShukla Laxman Bhat (b. Shirali, 19 March 1902; d. Bombay, 17 December 1964).\\nIt is indeed a pity that both the sahapatis of H. H. Shrimat Anandashram Swami\\npassed away on the eve of momentous occasions--Vittal Subraya Bhat, four days\\nbefore the 60th Birthday celebrations; and Shukla Laxman Bhat, a fortnight be\\nfore the inauguration of the Golden Jubilee year of His Holiness\\'s ordination.\\n\\n     Laxman Bhat was the third of the four sons of Shukla Mangesh Bhat, the\\nthen Manegar  of Shri Chitrapur Math. He studied up to the 5th Standard\\n(Kannada) at Shirali. He also learnt English on his own initiative and was able\\nto read simple constructions. Young Laxman practised the various rituals, in\\ncluding the Mahapuja of Lord Bhavanishankar, and took charge of pujas at the\\nMath when he was only 14 years old.\\n\\n     Referring to his scholastic ability, His Holiness said recently: \"Laxman,\\nby virtue of studying the Krishna Yajur-Veda, was truly a Vaidik. He had also\\nstudied Sanskrit grammar, vocabulary, poetry and literature, which are necessary\\nfor acquiring a true knowledge of that language. By studying various books, he\\nhad also gained the knowledge of religious tenets, Vedanta, etc.\"\\n\\n     Laxman Bhat was elected as Secretary of the Chitrapur Saraswat Vaidiks\\'\\nConference when it first met in 1945, and held that position for 11 years. Later,\\nalthough he resigned the Secretaryship in favour of younger priests, he continued\\nto be an active member of the Vaidiks\\' Conference. He also took keen interest\\n------- PAGE END -------\\n12\\n\\n in the Sanskrit Pathashala at Shirali where he taught Mantras and Kavya for\\n many years.\\n\\n       Laxman Bhat\\'s love of music and flair for public speaking stood him in good\\n stead when he commenced delivering kirtans and pravachans. His lasting achieve\\n ments were the publication of Shri Chitrapur   Padyavali,  the recording of Shankara\\n Narayana    Gitam on a gramophone disc in 1944, and the composition of additional\\n Sanskrit verses for inclusion in the Deepanamaskara and Narayanapada after the\\n Shishya Sweekar of 1959.\\n\\n      The Community will long remember and cherish his dignified bearing when\\n performing puja, his deep sonorous voice while singing bhajans, his learned pra-\\n vachans and kirtans, and, above all, his motto to love and be loved in return.\\n\\n                   The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;\\n                  blessed be the name of the Lord.\\n                                                         --The Old Testament.')]"

While a detailed report is appearing in this\\nissue separately, I need to mention that the entire tour of\\nBadri was meticulously planned and was carried out with\\nprecision under the leadership of Nitin Gokammam,  Preeti\\nMajumderpatchi and the designated team from Delhi Sabha.\\nSimilarly, the journey to Varanasi was well planned and\\nwhile Swamiji had an opportunity to review the renovation\\nwork at our Math building, the sadhakas had enjoyed the\\nwell planned tours to various temples including a boat ride\\nand a dip in the holy Ganges. Swamiji is very happy with\\nthe way the arrangements were done at each place. Kudos\\nto each and every member of the organising team from Delhi\\nSabha for the seva they carried out to make the yatra a\\nmemorable one.\\n    Immediately on return, Swamiji had to rush to Honnavar\\nwherein the Managing Committee of Ramdev-Venkatramana\\nTemple, Honnavar were hosting Swamiji for the first time.\\nThe programme started with Shobha Yatra with great fan\\nfare and the entire programme for five days was very well\\nattended by all the Saraswats from Honnavar and nearby\\nplaces. Large number of members of Yuva-Vahini as well as\\nMahila-Vahini took part in their inter-active sessions with\\nSwamiji and in the absence of any cultural programmes\\nplanned, the sadhakas got the benefit of participating in\\nwell orchestrated programmes like discourses on Bhagvad\\nGeeta, Navaratri Nitya-Path, Sanskrit conversation, Gayatri\\nAnusthans and daily evening poojas. In the otherwise quiet\\ntownship, the Ramdev Temple precints in Honnavar was\\nbuzzing with religious fervour with over 300 participants\\nescalating to 700 of them on two days.
