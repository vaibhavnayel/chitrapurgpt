As far as\npossible, one should always be engrossed in the\nmeditation of the Lord, and this is an easy means\nof realizing Him. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna\nsays :\nDevev3e(r)eslee: meleleb 3ees ceeb mcejefle efvel3eMe:~\nlem3eenb megueYeb HeeLe& efvel3e3egJeIlem3e 3eesefieve:~~\n[\"O Partha, one who meditates on Me with single-\nminded devotion, constantly and daily, to such a\ndevotee who is unwaveringly and always meditating\non Me, I am easy to approach.\"] Here, meditation\nhas been qualified by two adjectives: constant and\ndaily. Both these aspects are essential. Constantly\nmeans without a break, and daily means literally\nevery day. One person meditates for a short while\nwithout a break but later gives it up; such meditation\nis constant but not daily. Another person meditates\ndaily for a little while and then completely forgets\nO DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\nLet my Pranams be in my Deeds.\nTo offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n- Smt.

Therefore, in order to\nstress the need for meditating on the Lord as far as\npossible, throughout one's life-time, and without a\nbreak, the two adjectives, namely, constant and daily,\nhave been used.\nSuch meditation, without any means or support,\nis possible only for those devotees who are of a high\norder. For others, some means are necessary. Hymns\non the Lord and the Lord's name are indeed the\nbest means. There is an intimate connection between\na word and its meaning. Immediately on uttering a\nword, we become cognizant of its meaning. This\ncognisance, when continued like a stream for a long\ntime, is called meditation. When we are chanting\nhymns or the Lord's names, we are reminded again\nand again of the Lord who is invoked by the hymns\nor the true meaning of the names. In this way,\nwords become a means to meditation. Patanjali, in\nhis Yoga Sutras, after explaining the characteristics\nof God, says:\n1) lem3e Jee(r)eJeA: OeCeJe:\n2) leppeHemleoLeY=YeeJeveced\n[\"The word Om is the name of the Lord; the\nchanting of the word Om means meditation of the\nLord invoked by it.\"] Thus, it is made clear that a\nword becomes a means of meditation. The reasoning,\napplicable to Om, is also applicable to such other\nthings as the chanting of hymns, singing of the\nLord's names and bhajans, and reading of Stotras.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 20237\nIn this context, we think two Mantras from the\nUpanishads may be cited. For describing meditation,\nthey give the following example; Sharavedha\n(releasing an arrow) and Arani-manthan (rubbing of\none piece of wood against another for production of\nfire for a Yajna)\nOeCeJees Oeveg: Mejes ?eelcee ye'ie leuue#3eceg(r)3eles~\nDeOeceEesve Jesak3eb MejJeEevce3ees YeJesled~~\n[\"Om is the bow; the soul of the devotee is the\narrow; the Brahman is the target for this arrow; the\narrow should be released with alertness; then; just as\nan arrow merges into its target, similarly the soul of\nthe devotee becomes one with the Brahman.\"] The\nconclusion is that, just as an arrow, with the means\nof a bow, joins its target, similarly the devotee,\nmeditating on the Brahman with one-pointed mind,\nwith the means of the word Om, becomes one with\nthe Brahman.\nmJeosncejeECe JeaAlJee OeCeJeb (r)eesEejejefCeced~\nO3eeveefvece&LeeveeY3eemeeIsJe HeM3esefVeiet{Jeled~~\n[\"One's body, that is heart, is the bottom piece\nof wood, and the word Om is the upper piece of\nwood. Just as the latent fire in the two pieces of\nwood becomes visible by rubbing them over and over\nagain, similarly by meditation one gets the vision of\nthe Lord who resides hidden in all living beings.\"]\nThe substance of this is that if, by means of the\nword Om, one meditates with his mind and heart on\nthe Lord for a long while, the Lord reveals Himself.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 20238\nHow performance of Japa, singing of prayers, etc.\nare of great help in meditation has been suggested\nby Lord Krishna in the Bhagawad Gita :\nmeleleb JeAerle&3evlees ceeb 3elevle 1/2e oa{Je'lee:~\nvecem3evle 1/2e ceeb YeJeIl3ee efvel3e3egJeIlee GHeemeles ~~\n[\"Devotees always lovingly offering prayers to Me\nand endeavoring to attain Me by observing their vow\nof worship or by firmly protecting their good way of\nlife; likewise, offering salutations to Me and always\nengrossed in meditating on Me; they worship Me.\"]\nThe three-fold worship done by speech, body and\nmind is implied in the words Kirtayantah,\nNamasyantah and Nityayuktah.\nIn the present context, the people who have gathered\nhere, both women and men,- by performing Japa,\nmeditation, singing the Lord's name, bhajan, and\nvoluntary service such as carrying water, serving food,\nclearing used leaves, sweeping floors, and, in the\nkitchen, cutting vegetables, grating, etc- appear to\nhave performed three-fold service referred to earlier\nfrom the Bhagawad Gita. Similarly, by coming here in\nthis hot summer from faraway places, undergoing\nseveral difficulties, and by taking part in the Golden\nJubilee celebrations of the ordination of their Dharma-\nGuru, by performing Gayatri Japa, etc, they have proved\ntheir unshaken faith in Dharma. That the Paramatman\nwho ever loves His devotees may grant all your desires,\nensure your ever-increasing prosperity and salvation,\nand always protect you, is our prayer at His Lotus\nFeet, and we bless you accordingly.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

We usually\nspeak on Bhakti and Jnana but, while coming here,\nwe brought with us some Shlokas. A couple of days\nback, we spoke on Yoga Vashishta. Yesterday, at\nArun Heble's, it was a small audience and we spoke\non Bhakti. Today, rather unexpectedly, we have been\nasked to speak to you in this Ganapati temple and\nwe have thought of speaking to you on Brahma\nTatva and Atma Tatva.\nThe Upanishads tell us in a meaningful Shloka\nthat we have all come into the world assuming various\nforms of Prakriti and once having been born in this\nunfortunate condition, we should not strive for\nexternal things alone. We are not born only to commit\none deed after another, good or bad. We must\nendeavour to find out why we have taken this human\nbirth, what is our true goal in life, we must try to\nunderstand what is the inner Self, our Atma Shakti.\nIf we do not do this, the Upanishads say, we will\ncontinue to rotate in this cycle of birth and death,\nwe will continue to commit sins and suffer travails.\nIf we do not realise the Self, our human birth is not\nvindicated.

It is very easy to speak about the Self,\nthe Atma Tatva, but it is difficult to realise. Vedas\nspeak in difficult terms, but the Upanishads have\nsimplified the Truth for us so that we can understand\nit easily. Of all the Upanishads, the Kathopanishad\nexplains in the simplest of language which even a\nchild can understand. Today, we will speak to you\non the Kathopanishad which starts with the story\nof a small boy.\nKathopanishad speaks of a Rishi named\nVajashravas who was engaged in performing the\nVishwajeet Yaga . This Yaga means giving away\nwhatever one loves most in life, what we regard as\nour dearest possessions. He who performs this Yaga\nthus gives to the Brahmins all his worldly possessions.\nVajashravas is depicted as giving away cows, rice,\nghee and so many other things to the Brahmins. As\nhe goes on performing the \"havan\" and donating\nthese articles, his eight-year-old son Nachiketa sits\nin a corner watching the Yaga. Though of tender\nyears and uneducated, this son of Vajashravas is\nendowed with keen perceptivity and he is distressed\nto see his father give away to the Brahmins barren\ncows, cows which cannot even chew grass. Seeing\nthis, Nachiketa felt sad. He knew that only one's\ndearest possessions should be given away while doing\nsuch a Yaga. He also knew that he was his father's\npet, his dearest possession. So, he went up to his\nfather and asked him whom he was going to give\naway his son Nachiketa. Vajashravas, busy with the\nrites, told Nachiketa not to disturb him but to go\nand sit in a corner. Nachiketa obeyed him but, after\nsome time, he again went to his father and asked\nhim the same question: Father, whom are you going\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202311\nto give me? Again, he was asked to go to the corner\nand sit there and not to disturb the father. This\nwent on twice or thrice and, when Nachiketa popped\nthe question once again, his father lost his temper\nand burst out: \"I am giving you to Yama, the god of\ndeath\". This was just as we sometimes use curse\nwords, when we lose our temper. But, here, any\nutterance while performing a Yaga became a vow,\nwhich had to be fulfilled. Nachiketa himself was very\nhappy to hear his father's words. For, though death\nis something dreaded by the whole world (in fact\ndeath is what everyone is most afraid of), Nachiketa,\nthough so young, was very happy that he was to be\nsent to Yama because he looked on this as an\nopportunity to know what was death and mortality.\nWhen Nachiketa goes there, he finds Yama is out\nand is not back for three days. According to\nconvention, when you go to someone's house and\nyou find he has gone out, you have to wait outside\nthe door or go back the way you have come. When\nYama returns, he thus finds Nachiketa waiting\noutside his door, this lustrous little \"vatu\", and Yama\nasks him what is the matter. Nachiketa narrates all\nthat had happened. When Yama hears that he had\nto wait for three days outside his door, he washes\nhis feet and seeks his pardon for having made him\nwait.\nYama tells his young visitor \"I have never made\nany visitor to my domain wait like this. So, by way\nof penitence, I want to confer three boons on you.\nAsk what you will, you can have it.\" Nachiketa then\nfirstly seeks peace of mind for his father and then\nalso seeks welfare and prosperity of his father. By\nway of the third boon, Nachiketa asks Yama what is\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202312\nAtma Tatva. When a man dies, what happens to his\nsoul? Does the record of his good and bad deeds\nperformed while on earth attach itself to his soul\nfrom birth to birth? Yama, loath to reveal the secrets\nof life, tries to distract the boy by offering him Apsaras,\npromising him long life, untold wealth etc. and begs\nof him to ask for one of these as boons. Nachiketa\ntells Yama: As long as you are there, people are\nbound to be scared of you and I too will have to\ncome back to you some day or the other. Instead,\nnow that I am already with you, you can tell me\nwhat is Self and how to attain it.\nThe Upanishad then speaks of Self-knowledge or\nAtma Jnana in three or four shlokas, as spoken by\nYama to Nachiketa. Firstly, he says, Self-realization\nis such a state which, once having been attained,\ndoes not disappear nor do you, in that blissful state,\never feel like emerging from it. That Self-realization\nis not derived from external objects. What is it then?\nHe speaks of Shreya and Preya as the two paths\nbefore man. He who follows the path of Shreya will\nbe, in the words of the Upanishads, \"Atha Satyam\nAsti\". He will fare well in life, he will be well provided\nfor and he will end up by realising God. But, he who\ngoes by the path of Preya will get only transitory\npleasures and ends up by losing everything. Shreya\nand Preya are Nivriti Marga and Pravriti Marga\nrespectively. He who keeps his mind transfixed on\nhis goal, who does not allow his mind to become\nrestless, who remains cool and calm in all\ncircumstances, is said to have chosen Shreya and\nsuch a man wants to make the most of this human\nbirth itself without waiting for another. He takes\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202313\nthis life as the only one he is ever going to have and\npursues his goal with single-mindedness. On the\nother hand, he who goes after worldly pleasures is\nsaid to have opted for Preya. Shreya means Eternal\nHappiness while Preya means transitory pleasures.\nKathopanishad, having identified these two paths,\nthen tell us that we should always go by the path\nof Shreya.\n(Continued)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

You begin to understand\nyourself better, there is a lot of debris that has to be shed,\nyou have to give up a lot, you will understand people in a\nbetter manner, your reactions will have changed, your\nunderstanding will have deepened.\nDeep inside the Bhadra forest, under the bright green leaf of a\ntree, lived Gomtu - a tiny, unhatched caterpillar. He was happy\ninside the tiny egg - it was a perfect world. So, he continued to\nslumber for days on end, in a state of deep contentment.\nOne fine summer morning, something strange happened. He\nfelt something funny in his tummy - was it a pang of hunger? A\ntiny voice inside him prompted him to eat his way out of the\negg. \"This is not all. There is so much more to explore,\" it said.\n\"To reach your own fullness, you must step out of your comfort\nzone.\" Gomtu tried to muffle that voice and just drown it in his\nstupor . But the voice persisted until he awakened. Now, Gomtu\nwas left with no choice but to nibble away at the egg.\nThus began Gomtu's journey.\nIt was going to be a long and\ngrinding one, but Gomtu was\nH. H. Shrimat Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji*\n Gomtu passes with flying colours\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202345\nhappy to take it just one chomp at a time. His hunger seemed\ninsatiable, so Gomtu scarfed his way through, until finally, he\nhad crawled out of his egg and was greeted by the most\nincredible view!\nThere was lush greenery everywhere, with flowers of different\ncolours. There were delicious leaves on many different trees,\nwith birds singing and monkeys swinging under an incredibly\nblue sky! What's more, there were many caterpillars like him,\nfeasting on the leaves. 'Ah! This must be paradise,' thou ght\nGomtu, 'this is where I was meant to be.' So, he joined them in\nthe grand fete and munched away in glee.\nGomtu made plenty of friends, but Chintu was the dearest. As if\nin an eating match, the two chowed down leaf after leaf. 'If you\nstop, you lose' seemed to be the unwritten rule. So, chomp,\nchomp, chomp they went... all the way through.\nWith every passing day, they grew plumper and longer . One day,\nGomtu noticed that Chintu looked different - he had begun to\nshed his skin. He looked funny, but Gomtu suppressed a giggle.\nYet, deep within, he could not help but gloat. 'Why shouldn't I?'\nhe chuckled to himself, 'Afterall, don't I have the fuzziest green\ncoat?'\nA few days later, Gomtu noticed that something inside him had\nchanged... everything felt so tight! He wondered if he too would\nmeet the same fate as Chintu and tried to put up a fight. That is\nwhen the tiny voice inside him spoke: \"You have so much more\nto explore! To grow into your own fullness, you must learn to let\ngo.\"\nBy now, Gomtu knew better than to muffle that voice. So, he\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202346\nlistened and submitted himself to the moulting process with an\nopen heart. He did look awkward, but he learned to grin and\nbear. The embarrassment he suffered taught him never to gloat\nagain. When the moulting was over, Gomtu could not believe\nhis eyes! For under the dead skin, he found the same fuzzy\ngreen coat, with plenty of room to move about!\nAs they grew bigger, Gomtu and his friends went\nthrough a series of moults. Through all those ups\nand downs, Gomtu learnt to be confident, yet\nhumble and kind. One day, the most unexpected\nthing happened - Chintu stopped eating! He\nquietly hung himself upside down from a leaf\nand started spinning a cocoon around him.\n\"What is the matter, Chintu? There is so much more to eat! Why\ndid you give up so quickly? Why this hasty retreat??\" asked\nGomtu. \"There is much more to explore, Gomtu, a beautiful\njourney ahead. Sometimes, to grow into your own fullness, you\nmust turn within instead.\" Gomtu was aghast! \"What a silly\nthing to do,\" he scoffed. \"If  you had to shut yourself in again,\nwhy did you even bother to come out?!\"\nWith his best friend withdrawing, Gomtu was perplexed. He felt\nlonely and abandoned, so he stuffed himself some more. Just\nthen a beautiful bee came buzzing around! Gomtu watched in\nawe as she flew from flower to flower . He had so many\nquestions for her - \"Who are you? How did you learn fly?? What\ndoes one need to be able to do that? Do you think you could\nteach me too?\" Gomtu went on and on, but all that she offered\nwas a wise smile. \"It takes great power to change oneself\" she\nsaid, with a twinkle in her eye.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202347\nThis left Gomtu wondering - did he have that power too? He\nforgot all about the eating fest, for he now had a whole new path\nto tread. Over many days, Gomtu remained absorbed in deep\nthought, he did not sleep a wink. He mulled over what the tiny\nvoice had said - \"To grow into your own fullness, you must learn\nto let go\". Realization dawned and Gomtu finally understood\nwhat Chintu had meant.\nWith all the strength and courage that he could muster, Gomtu\nhung upside down from a twig. It was going to  be a slow and\nlonesome journey, yet, he was willing to dive right in. He\ndiligently spun a cocoon around himself and surrendered\ncompletely to the transformative process. There was a lot of\nhimself that he had to dissolve, it was going to be a gooey mess!\nUndeterred, Gomtu forged ahead.\nDays passed, but Gomtu persevered, until\nhis commitment and dedication bore fruit.\nWhen he finally emerged from his cocoon,\nhe had breathtakingly magnificent wings.\nBathed in a riot of bright colours, Gomtu\ntruly lived up to his name! Ecstatic over his\nnewfound freedom, he flew as high as he\ncould. Then he settled on a familiar branch to scan the beautiful\nlandscape.\nA beautiful butterfly fluttered by and settled\nright beside him. \"Ah! So, you made it too,\nGomtu,\" said he, with a knowing smile.\nGomtu looked deep into those discerning\neyes... there was something familiar about\nthat mischievous grin. Recognition quickly\ndawned, \"Chintu, is it you, my friend?!\"\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202348\nGomtu could not believe how majestic Chintu looked!

As far as\npossible, one should always be engrossed in the\nmeditation of the Lord, and this is an easy means of\nrealizing Him.

Constantly means\nwithout a break, and daily means literally every day.\nOne person meditates for a short while without a break\nbut later gives it up; such meditation is constant but\nnot daily. Another person meditates daily for a little\nwhile and then completely forgets the Lord at other\ntimes; such meditation is no doubt daily but it is not\n\n          O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n               Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n             - Smt.

Therefore, in order to stress the need for\nmeditating on the Lord as far as possible, throughout\none's life-time, and without a break, the two adjectives,\nnamely, constant and daily, have been used.\n    Such meditation, without any means or support,\nis possible only for those devotees who are of a high\norder. For others, some means are necessary. Hymns\non the Lord and the Lord's name are indeed the best\nmeans. There is an intimate connection between a\nword and its meaning. Immediately on uttering a\nword, we become cognizant of its meaning. This\ncognisance, when continued like a stream for a long\ntime, is called meditation. When we are chanting\nhymns or the Lord's names, we are reminded again\nand again of the Lord who is invoked by the hymns or\nthe true meaning of the names. In this way, words\nbecome a means to meditation.         Patanjali, in his Yoga\nSutras, after explaining the characteristics of God,\nsays:\n                    1) lem3e Jee(r)eJeA: OeCeJe:\n                    2) leppeHemleoLeY=YeeJeveced\n    [\"The word Om is the name of the Lord; the\nchanting of the word Om means meditation of the\nLord invoked by it.\"] Thus, it is made clear that a word\nbecomes a means of meditation. The reasoning,\napplicable to Om, is also applicable to such other\nthings as the chanting of hymns, singing of the Lord's\nnames and bhajans, and reading of Stotras.\n    In this context, we think two Mantras from the\nUpanishads may be cited. For describing meditation,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         6                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthey give the following example; Sharavedha (releasing\nan arrow) and Arani-manthan (rubbing of one piece\nof wood against another for production of fire for a\nYajna)\n            OeCeJees Oeveg: Mejes ?eelcee ye'ie leuue#3eceg(r)3eles~\n                DeOeceEesve Jesak3eb MejJeEevce3ees YeJesled~~\n    [\"Om is the bow; the soul of the devotee is the\narrow; the Brahman is the target for this arrow; the\narrow should be released with alertness; then; just as\nan arrow merges into its target, similarly the soul of\nthe devotee becomes one with the Brahman.\"] The\nconclusion is that, just as an arrow, with the means\nof a bow, joins its target, similarly the devotee,\nmeditating on the Brahman with one-pointed mind,\nwith the means of the word Om, becomes one with\nthe Brahman.\n               mJeosncejeECe JeaAlJee OeCeJeb (r)eesEejejefCeced~\n               O3eeveefvece&LeeveeY3eemeeIsJe HeM3esefVeiet{Jeled~~\n    [\"One's body, that is heart, is the bottom piece of\nwood, and the word Om is the upper piece of wood.\nJust as the latent fire in the two pieces of wood\nbecomes visible by rubbing them over and over again,\nsimilarly by meditation one gets the vision of the Lord\nwho resides hidden in all living beings.\"]  The\nsubstance of this is that if, by means of the word Om,\none meditates with his mind and heart on the Lord\nfor a long while, the Lord reveals Himself.\n    How performance of Japa, singing of prayers, etc\nare of great help in meditation has been suggested\nby Lord Krishna in the Bhagawad Gita :\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam           7                  January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nmeleleb JeAerle&3evlees ceeb 3elevle 1/2e oa{Je'lee:~\n           vecem3evle 1/2e ceeb YeJeIl3ee efvel3e3egJeIlee GHeemeles ~~\n    [\"Devotees always lovingly offering prayers to Me\nand endeavoring to attain Me by observing their vow\nof worship or by firmly protecting their good way of\nlife; likewise, offering salutations to Me and always\nengrossed in meditating on Me; they worship Me.\"]\nThe three-fold worship done by speech, body and\nmind is implied in the words Kirtayantah,\nNamasyantah and Nityayuktah.\n    In the present context, the people who have\ngathered here, both women and men,- by performing\nJapa, meditation, singing the Lord's name, bhajan,\nand voluntary service such as carrying water, serving\nfood, clearing used leaves, sweeping floors, and, in\nthe kitchen, cutting vegetables, grating, etc- appear\nto have performed three-fold service referred to earlier\nfrom the Bhagawad Gita. Similarly, by coming here\nin this hot summer from faraway places, undergoing\nseveral difficulties, and by taking part in the Golden\nJubilee celebrations of the ordination of their Dharma-\nGuru, by performing Gayatri Japa, etc, they have\nproved their unshaken faith in Dharma.

The same\ncrowd was there, but it was in an open place with a\npandal and a stage. We still vividly remember the scene\nof ten years ago, when His Holiness, with the Gita in\nHis hands had addressed you all on the 12th chapter.\nWe wish to speak to you all on the same subject. The\n12th Chapter of the Gita teaches us how to vindicate\nour human birth. The Lord has given us this human\nbody, endowed us with the five senses, made us direct\nall our attention outside, on objects of external\npleasures. It is not the fault of man that he has been\nendowed with the five senses which are capable of\nonly seeing the outside objects. To see one's true Self,\none must turn one's gaze inward. The Vedas and\nUpanishads are so framed that one should listen to\nthem to know that what one is doing now is wrong.\nReally speaking, we never asked God for this human\nbirth but we have attained by His will. The Lord is\ndescribed as Nirguna Nirvikar, the Supreme Bliss who\nwas once only one and there was no other person.\nThen, God felt that for the sake of His sport, He should\nproject this creation to enjoy His own Lila. So, to please\nHimself, He created this world. Thus, we all are here\nnot of our own volition but because God willed it so,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         9                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nfor His own enjoyment, because he wanted to test\nhow man would use the intellect and other qualities\ngiven to him by God. God wanted to see how this model\nof a man, so to speak, whom he had brought forth,\nfunctioned. So, we are all here because of Him, even\nthe ills and sorrows that beset us in our worldly\nexistence are His will. Once, we realize this supreme\ntruth, we will have vindicated our human birth.\n    As Krishan says in the Gita, once we have got this\nhuman body, we direct all senses a_nd activities\noutside. God is waiting to see if we remember Him\nand turn towards Him. Man's nature is such that he\nworks for his happiness, never for the happiness of\nothers.  One thing should be mentioned here and\nthat is our blind adherence to tradition. We simply\ngo on doing things because others have done it before\nus. We have never stopped to consider why others\nwere doing it and why we should do the same. One\nunderlying fact is that everyone does everything to\nattain happiness but, at the same time, what may\nbring joy to one may bring trouble to another.\n    For instance, there are unmarried people who long\nfor Sansar and want to get married thinking that their\nhappiness lies in that. But, once married, they have\nno end of troubles. That is why, it is said, what appears\nas happiness to one becomes sorrow to another. We\ncannot reason out from the worldly point of view why\ncertain objects give us happiness and why the same\nobjects also give us sorrow. Because, the real sources\nof happiness lies elsewhere. We should pause and\nthink for ourselves where this real happiness lies. We\ncannot explain what real happiness is, because it is\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        10                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nbeyond the bounds of even intellect, we can only draw\na simile. As, for instance, the quality of fire. The same\nfire which makes you hot and uncomfortable in\nsummer gives you warmth and comfort in winter.\n    Our ancients, in their own way had reasoned out\nthat there must be a cause for all this creation, for\nthe sun, moon, stars and that the motive power for\nthis creation is a Divine Power(Shakti) and also that\nthe world moves not because of us but because of this\nShakti. They taught us that having inherited this\nhuman birth, we have to enjoy all the creation created\nfor us by the Lord. Once we realize our place in this\nCreation, the transitory ills of the world cease to\ntrouble us. To achieve this state, the Lord tells us in\nthe Gita to control our senses, turn our vision inward\nand attain everlasting happiness.\n    There are some philosophers who preach that he\nwho is ready to embrace joy must be equally ready to\nface sorrow as well.    J. Krishnamurthi       is one of them.\nWhat he says is appropriate here. He says that if you\nare ready to experience joy, you must equally be\nprepared to accept and experience sorrow. Normally,\nman is willing to only experience joy and shuns away\nfrom sorrow. Once you have reached Krishnamurthi's\nstate, joy and sorrow means the same to you, birth\nand death are the same, this world we see before us\nand Illusion are the same, friend and enemy are the\nsame, in fact, everything is the same. When the\naspirant has reached this state, he does not need a\nGuru any longer, he has no need to perform Sadhana\nanymore. Neither does he feel the need to either hear\nor give Upadesh.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         11                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nWe have only one thing to say about this. Each\nman has his own concept of a Guru. He can accept\nanyone for his Guru, he may be from his own\ncommunity or from any other. Guru need not fit any\nparticular form as such. Krishna tells us that we can\neven have our own Self as our Guru.                        J.\nKrishnamurthi     also says that he does not need a Guru\nwho has attained Jnana in worldly matters, who has\nunderstood the basis for this experience. That is why\nwe said earlier that there is nothing like having only\none particular person as one's Guru. You can have\nanyone as your Guru. If you cannot get a Guru easily\nby your inner power, you can have your own divine\nSelf as your Guru.\n   WE have so far spoken about people who have\nreached J. Krishnamuri's level, who do not need a\nGuru, who do not need Sadhana etc. But, most people\nin the world have not reached this state. They are\nconstantly striving for happiness, all their actions are\ndirected towards winning happiness. WE remember\nthe story of Sadhaka in the Himalayas who was told\nby his Guru to keep a daily diary of all his thoughts,\nactions, how many hours he spends daily in talking,\nhow many untruths he uttered during the day, how\noften he had strayed from the straight and narrow\npath and so on. He told the disciple to do this so that\nhe can see for himself what he should do and should\nnot do as a Sadhaka. The Sadhaka begins by\nworshipping Name and Form and then makes himself\nfit for entering the World of Nirguna Nirvikar. Such a\nperson gets his guidance from the Guru who teaches\nhim how to progress on the spiritual path and give\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       12                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nhim appropriate Upadesh. The Guru knows, what is\nthe best type of Sadhana he should prescribe for the\nSadhaka. Sadhakas are of many kinds. There are\nthose who can easily progress by following the path\nof Bhakti, there are others who can progress only by\nthe path of Jnana Yoga. The Guru is the Teacher who\nteaches each disciple according to the time and the\nclime and his own individual needs.\n    Lord Krishna tells us in the Gita:\n              Devev3eeef 1/2evle3evlees ceeb 3es pevee: He3e&gHeemeles~\n             les<eeb efvel3eeefYe3egJeIleeveeb 3eesie#esceb Jenec3enced~~\n    (\"Those devotees, who, thinking about no one else,\nconstantly think of Me, and worship Me alone, to those\never united in thought with Me, I bring full security\nand personally attend to their needs\"). What He\nteaches us in this Shloka is that whatever be our work,\nwhatever be our function, if with single-minded\ndevotion, we concentrate on Him and Him alone, He\nwill render us safe and secure, \"Yogakshemam\nVahamyaham\"). There are troubles in the lot of\neveryone. Actually, there are devotees who pray to\nGod to give them troubles. Kunti's prayer to Krishna\nwas to give her always troubles and problems because,\nwe remember God only when troubles beset us. The\ndevotees tell the Lord-\"give us troubles, they do not\nfrighten us, because Your thought runs in our mind,\nwe remember You often and we repeat Your name\noften.\"\n    Krishna says that he has created this world for\nthe sake of His sport, at the same time He has endowed\nman with powers to resist the lure of this creation. If,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         13                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nby resisting the worldly pleasures, man attains Him,\nthen He assures him of all happiness. Instead, if man\nconcentrates only on the worldly pleasures, he\nremains rooted to the cycle of birth and death. Having\ncome on this worldly stage, he remains on the stage\nitself. The Bhagavat and other Puranas have been\nwritten by our ancients for our benefit. They speak of\nthe glories of the Lord and describe His divine sport.\nKrishna is Imown by many names-Gopala, Govinda.\nHis Lila is meant to turn our minds towards Him.\nKrishna's life has many facets-He is the divine thief\nwho steals butter, He is divine Lover who has\nthousands of Gopis mad after Him, while as the King,\nthough He has his own kingdom, Krishna gets Himself\ninvolved in the affairs and politics of others and strives\nfor their welfare. He is also portrayed as the warrior\nwho displays His immense powers in war. Again,\nthough a Kshatriya, he becomes the great Teacher.\nYet, in all these activities, He remains the Supreme\nLord. He is called Govinda, namely, One who draws\nus away from the Indriyas, which are pulled by the\noutside world. In all His Names and activities, the\nsyllable \"Go\" is repeated every time: Gopal, Govind,\nGovardhan, Gokul. The great Lord is shown as the\nstealer of butter. At first hearing, it sounds absurd.\nHe was a royal Prince, why did He have to go to others'\nhouses to break pots and steal butter when He could\nhave it in His own house? What sort of a God was He\nthen?\n    We can look at it this way. Our body is the pot\nwhich is filled with Void (Akash). When this pot breaks,\nthe Void within merges with the void outside and they\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        14                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nbecome one. Krishna is portrayed as breaking this\npot, namely this feeling that one is the body, and\nstealing the butter from within. The butter is His\nrealization that comes after churning the sour Sansar\nof life. Krishna's Lilas include the incident of His\nstealing the clothes of the Gopis and hiding them in\na tree. How could the Lord do such a thing? Here,\nyou should not go by the apparent meaning. \"Gopi\"\nneed not be a woman alone. Anyone who strives for\nHim is a Gopi. Only in recent times, the term \"vastra\"\nis taken to mean only clothes. Everyone is clothed in\nthree desires-the desire for wife and family, the desire\nfor wealth and the desire for name and fame. They\nare the three \"vasanas\" and, one who is clothed in\nthese three Vasanas is known as one wearing a\n\"vastra\". Man may overcome the first two desires but\nthe last desire that for name and fame cannot be easily\ngiven up. Hence, Krishna, the Beloved Lord and Lover\nof His devotees, is depicted as removing the three\nVasanas (\"vastra\") from the devotee (Gopi) so that he\nmay look up at Him and attain salvation.\n    Krishna's names have meaning of their own. He is\nknown as Gopal, or One who deliberately draws our\neyes outside for the sake of His divine sport. He is\nknown as Govardhan or One who continually tests us\nby giving us attractions outside. He is known as Govind\nor One who teaches us that we are not the Indriyas,\nthat we are not the transitory things in life. All these\nare Krishna. To understand such a Lord, we should\nalways do His remembrance, Namasankirtan. We\nshould dwell on His glories, on His divine sport. Once\nwe understand Him and realize Him, we can always\ndwell in Him and be with Him. The main thing is,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        15                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nonce we attain Him, our struggle for happiness is\nended and we attain eternal peace and happiness and\nwe remain His devotees always and thus vindicate this\nhuman birth of ours.\n    For the last two days and two nights that we have\nstayed here, we have been treated with all love and\ndevotion by the laity here.

He had become one with the Devi .... So\nwhat is that? We can say, it is a little sophisticated.\nIt is the Mother as Rajarajeshwari, She is the\nEmpress. She is holding the noose and the goad,\nikshu - dhanusha, the sugarcane, the bow and She\nholds the    yeeCe, the arrows. She is the         Pancha\nTanmatra   Sayaka, She is creating the Universe using\nthe five subtle sense faculties - shabda (sound),\nsparsh (touch), roop (form), rasa (taste) and gandh\n(smell). She is in Her Bliss, She doesn't see\nanything other than Herself because there is nothing\nelse. Immersed in Her own joy, She is expressing\nHer Brahmashakti, (Creative Power). So I used to\nsay, we pray that I am in trouble here, please\nshower your Grace on me ... when I pray like this,\nthen like any Mother, She responds and keeping\nthe bow and arrows aside, first She Blesses us with\nAbhaya - fearlessness and then reveals the Varada\nMudra - in readiness to bestow boons. So abhaya\nand varada instead of the Dhanusha and the arrows,\nthat is Bhuvaneshwari. Do you understand?  So,\neven in the Vigraha, the idol, even in dhyan murti\n- the form that we meditate upon, there is\ntremendous significance. So, once you are assured\nof Her Grace, maybe entry into Shrividya is possible\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       17               January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nwhich had been completely attained by Pujya\nSwamiji. So in    Upasana, worship ... I think I'll be\nelaborating on this - In     Upasana using my mind,\nspeech and body - whatever, whatever I do\nphysically, mentally, I can do something because\nemotions are involved there at every stage and\nverbally also I do. Is it not so? So, if I have made\na mistake at any of these levels of mind, speech or\nbody, may I be forgiven, is the prayer. So, here\nwhen you ... when a person does the puja, not only\nhe is doing some       Upacharas and uttering some\nmantras, the whole body is to be used and in that\nsophistication a lot of Mudras are displayed. Mudam\ndravyati - a gesture which releases joy - that is\ncalled Mudra. Suddenly there is a cascade of joy.\nLike somebody starts off very seriously and we are\nlistening. I do not understand, where is this leading\nto and then suddenly there is a punch line and you\nrealize it is a joke, there is a surge of joy.\nRemember, again, if you don't catch it, somebody\nanalyses the joke for you, the joke has been\ndestroyed. You get or you don't get it. A very small\nexample. So Mudras are actually bringing out,\nexpressing and invoking also, evoking that joy. That's\nwhy Mudras are performed. So, during\nDipanamaskara, while meditating upon Pujya\nAnandashram Swamiji, while paying obeisance to His\nGuru, Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji performed the\nMudra used for offering prostrations to the Devi. In\nfact He was then invoking that Gurushakti through\nthat Mudra. And when the shloka with His name\nwas chanted, He would sit quietly, in total peace -\nwhich meant up till there I accept the Guru Shakti's\nGrace as my Guru! Do you understand? That is the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      18                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nsignificance of using that particular Mudra at that\ntime. The entire Parampara, Anugraha is being\ninvoked. Anugraha itself is the Shakti, the Power,\nthe Devi, but She is coming in the form of\nPurvacharyas. So, during Dipanamaskara as soon as\nthe Guru was invoked, prostration was offered and\nthen He would sit quietly, peacefully, losing Himself\nin that Presence. That is what the Acharyas do and\nso Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji showed us that\npath through His own actions.\n                                           - Shirali 2020\n     Guru Shakti - Its impact on a seeker\n                  when it is released\n   51 years ago (in 1967) (Parijnanashram Swamiji\n(III) accepted the position as Spiritual Head of the\nMath. He accepted that responsibility for our sake,\nthus assuring us of His presence. He could have\nremained and absorbed in His Fullness and need\nnot have bothered with our troubles, but no, He took\nup that responsibility and accepted the\nMathadhipatya. We bring that to mind today. And\nsince it is Vijayadashmi, we reiterate on this\nauspicious day that we will, we are always with You.\nWe can never be denied Your presence. At the same\ntime, to understand You, we will deal intelligently\nwith Your Shakti. Shaktis. Do you understand that?\nThe Shakti, the Divine Force - will demand, \"I want\nthis.\" The Guru does not do that. Though the Guru\nis a Force in Himself, the Shakti will say, \"See you\nhave not done what I have said. Now I'll deal with\nyou.\" The Guru does not say that. The Guru does\nnot have any desire., because He is complete in\nHimself. He is Shiva. He is Bhavanishankar. But it\nis for our sake that His Shakti is released. Have you\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19               January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nnot read the Saptshati? Specific Shaktis are created\nto combat specific demons that arise. How else can\nI explain it! Internally, every spiritual aspirant\nattempts to become a disciple. A number of demons\nare seated in his heart, and they thwart his\nattempts. So to assist the aspirant, the Shaktis begin\nto manifest. Those Shaktis are remarkable! They work\nboth internally and externally! So, they bring about\ncircumstances too where you have to accept (the\npresence of those demons) and then overcome\n(them). Don't deny. This is entirely between the\nGuru and the disciple. That is how it is. And then,\nthe Guru also rewards. Which is why much good\nhappens internally for the aspirant. To the extent\nhis self-assurance increases, he is able to express\nhimself correctly-So, to \"What shall I do now?\" and\n\"How shall I express myself?\" The Shakti says, \"Yes!\nDisplay My Divine Magnificence!\" And so we see art,\nor a unique ability, or something wonderful\nmanifesting in an aspirant's life, in his person and\nin his place of work. Every Sadhaka would have\nexperienced that. But a sadhaka is not satisfied with\nthat. He reflects, \"What is the source of this?\" The\nsource is the Guru, and not just the Gurushakti.\nThe Guru alone. And the Guru is in His Fullness.\nSo, if I have to submerge myself into that Fullness,\nI cannot approach that Fullness as a doer and an\nexperiencer alone. I cannot prove that I am\ndeserving, that the Guru is fortunate to get a shishya\nlike me. This does not work. So, our qualifications\nthemselves begin to change. When dealing with the\nShakti as long as you have to deal with, you have\nto assert, you have to prove yourself to yourself and\nyou will come out as a better sadhaka, almost\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nshishya. But the Shishya's orientation completely\nchanges. He can deal with his ego also. Otherwise\nthe ego is always hidden. It will come in the way\nof our transactions with the Guru and it will\ndefinitely be - how shall I put it .... Shamelessly\nmanifested in how you behave. Because in your\ndealings, if your ego is there and you try to say,\nI have no ego ... dangerous! So, you fine tune your\nahankara in your vyavahara but don't deny, don't\npretend it is not there when you deal with the Guru.\nSo that, since you still have the ahankara, since you\nwant it's purification, we don't deal with the Guru,\nwe deal with the Gurushakti.\n                                            - Karla 2018\n When the Divine Power becomes the Mother\n Let me give you an example you can relate to,\nsince people have asked if a Guru is even\nnecessary. Scriptures, the arts, whether spiritual or\notherwise, do not reveal their mystic secrets without\nthe grace of the Guru. We all accept that. It does\nnot happen by simply referring to books. \"Okay.\nSince I believe in God, go to temples, perform the\nritual bathing of the Lord every Monday, what is\nthe necessity of a Guru?\" A Guru is required. Why?\nListen. You get pujas done. You have a deep desire\nfor something. It is for that reason that your efforts\nare on, so you have pujas and other rituals\nperformed. Should there be the intensity and the\nfaith, you may even receive what you wanted. How\nwill that be beneficial or good for you? None can\nreally say. Do you understand? A child with money\nin hand, goes to a shop to buy something to eat.\n\"I want that,\" he says. The shopkeeper counts the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       21               January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ncoins, then he gives the child what he wants. The\nshopkeeper is hardly going to ask the child if what\nhe has bought will benefit him or cause him harm.\nHe has to run his business after all. But should\nthe child ask his mother for something, the mother\nwill say, \"If you eat this now, you will have an\nupset stomach. I will not give it to you.\" Similarly\nwhen the Shakti - the Power of the Divine - takes\nresponsibility for us, She is called the Gurushakti.\nSo, should you invoke the Lord and get a puja\nperformed with the belief that your job is done,\nthen you might receive the fruits of that worship,\nbut you won't know it is truly for your good. But\nwhen we seek refuge in Her and invoke Her, with\nthe appeal that whatever we receive be for our good,\nand that this is the reason we are worshipping Her,\nthen the Shakti acts for our benefit, just as a\nmother does. That is when the Shakti becomes the\nDivine Power that showers Grace.\n                                            - Karla 2018\n  Working in tandem with that Divine Power\n   This is my prayer - we are invested with a\ntremendous resource, the Shakti of the\nGuruparampara which is galvanized to guide us, and\nis already doing it. We just have to accept it without\nresisting it. Whether we want it or not, we will be\nguided, since we have already given our\ncommitment. When that is the case, we can make\nit less painful, we can make it more enjoyable, when\nwe do it intelligently. So, always keep in mind there\nis an infinite dimension within myself - something\nbig, something benevolent and that Shakti which is\nat work, has come to do me good and it has the\ncapacity to bring not just happiness, peace and\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       22               January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nplentifulness in my life, but it has the capacity to\nhelp me acquire extraordinary abilities. Then start\ntransacting. But we may become petty. We may get\nstuck in unimportant details. And to be stuck,\nespecially in seva, is very painful. That's when we\nseek the Divine's utterance of 'hoon' to burn the\npettiness and \"I'm getting stuck\" to ashes. Don't try\nto waste your logic on it. Just discard that\n(pettiness)and rise. If we do this, then we would truly\nbe doing Swamiji's, Parijnanashram Swamiji's seva.\nSwamiji's life itself is one of Divine wonder. Results\nare always quick. That is His power. If we are dull,\nit gets a little boring. So, if we awaken to the ...\nthis power that is, this Parampara, it will become\nvery, very enjoyable. So in seva when you find you\nare getting down, or that something can't be done,\nor there may be some correction required, then pray\nand demand - \"Let me rise up through this!\" If you\ndo at least this much, then you will see, that not\njust what you expect or need in life - the happiness,\npeace and plentifulness, but the beauty of your soul\nwill begin to manifest! Respond to it! That is my\nappeal to the Divine. May Swami accept my prayer\nand grant all sadhakas all that is auspicious. I truly\nfeel so deeply content - I sense the pulsating\npresence of Swami all around! May He alone guide\nus protect us and confer fulfillment upon every\nsadhaka!\n                                             - Karla 2014\n                (Transcribed by Shrikala Kodikal)\n\n Please look up Anushravas for all the photos\n        of Sanskriti Parichaya Yatra 2023.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        23                January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Man is ever striving to fulfil\nwhatever his mind is after. Too many desires trigger\nman to be on a constant run to achieve his wish.\nEven if an object of desire is attained eventually, it\ndoes not last long. Peace of mind is far away from\nhim forever.\n    Our ancestors have therefore said that if lasting\nhappiness and peace is to be found, restraint of\nsenses and mind        (indriya and mano nigraha)          is of\nutmost necessity. For, senses that are not under\ncontrol will drag a man down to undesirable lanes\nand destroy him.\n    Therefore, if man uses his intellect to discriminate\nbetween actions that would benefit him and those that\nare undesirable, he can then attain lasting welfare.\nMan must take care to ensure that thoughts driven\nby excessive desires, pride and vengeful attitude do\nnot overpower his mind even momentarily.\n    Controlling and conquering one's mind is akin to\nconquering the world.

They\nare 'nandita'), made joyous by the Master's revelation\nof Truth. For joy or soul satisfaction is the immediate\nand only fruit of enlightenment. What else can a true\nstudent of knowledge seek for?\n    The word 'Ashesha (all) qualifying           'manunindra'\nstresses the fact that the field of enlightenment\nrecognizes no barrier of time or space, class or creed.\nAll those who get established in the deep silence with\nor in the mystical presence of the Master will certainly\nbecome enlightened and blissful, as men who\napproach fire are warmed up. Whether he is a              yaqui\naspirant in the Mexican mountains or the Indian\ncounterpart on the opposite side of the earth, whether\nhe is reared in Shaivism or Taoism, the soul-force is\nthe same and is released through the power of silence.\nHere we find    Dakshinamurti      raised above all 'isms' to\nthe height of the pure      Guru   concept.\n10)  vevoerMeeefoceosefMeJeA:\n    The foremost of the Masters or great Acharyas like\nNandisha.\n    Nandisha     or Nandikesha      or simply    Nandi    is the\nname of a mythological figure, who appeared from\nbelow the ploughed land of          Rishi Shilada, to whom\nShiva promised to appear as a son,          Nandi   propitiated\nShiva through stern austerity, and was accepted as\nHis attendant     (Hee<e&o:);and an inseparable part of the\nHoly Pentagon     (efMeJeHe_(r)ee3eleveced).Nandiassumes the form\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         26                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nof a powerful bull for Shiva to ride upon. According to\nthe  Puranas, he is the personification of              Dharma\n(OeceexJea<e:). The Lord directly initiated him into\nShivajnana, and     Nandishvara, in his turn became one\nof the early Acharyas of      Shaivism. The word can also\nbe interpreted to mean, Shiva who is the form of the\nAcharya-parampara, of which                    Nandishvara,\nKartikeya   and other     ganas are forerunners.\n    It may be interpreted in a third sense, in which\nNandisha' merely means those who are in possession\nof the supreme joy of Self-realization.\n11)  ceesneveue-megOeemeej:\n    The shower of nectar that puts out the conflagration\nof false knowledge.\n12)  ceesnecyegpe-megOeeJeAj:\n    The moon-rise which makes the blooming lotus of\nmoha to fold its petals.\n13)  ceesnevOeJeAejlejefCe:\n    He who is a sun to the dark night of non-\nperception.\n14)  ceesneslHeueveYeesceefCe :\n    The sunshine that negates the effect of the night-\nlily, called moha.\n    The four names illustrate the power of delusion\n(Moha)   and the mode of its destruction.         Moha    is very\ndifficult to understand; it is not attachment, which is\ntermed as raga. The word        moha   is from the root    'muh'\n- which means to hide or cover. Thus           moha   will mean\na clouding, an unknowing, from which arise all our\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         27                  January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ninfatuations, actions and tribulations. It is very\npeculiar and dangerous; at the same time it is like\nwalking in sleep. You cannot stop it without\nawakening, without shattering this slumber of               moha.\nDakshinamurti      does this in various ways, depending\non the depth of the slumber, the kind of hypnotism\nthat holds the soul.\n    The Devi Bhagvata speaks of five kinds of             moha   as\nthe aspects of primordial ignorance or            Avidya:\n               leceescefJeJesJeAes ceesn: m3eeovle:JeAjCeefJeYe'ce~\n                ceneceesnmleg efJe%es3ees ueec3eYeesiemegKew<eCee~~\n                cejCeb lJevOeleeefcemeb leeefcemeb !eAesOe G(r)3eles ~\n                DeefJeDee Heb(r)eHeJex<ee OeeogYe&tuee cenelceve:~~\n    First, the darkness       (tamas)   that comes of lack of\ndiscrimination     (viveka)  . Second is ordinary moha that\ncauses mental illusions.          Mahamoha is the intense\ndesire for gross enjoyments. Next is the          tamisra, which\narises as the blinding effect of rage. The total blackout\nat the time of death is called     andha-tamasra. The Linga\nPurana also mentions these five categories of                moha\nand identifies them as        avidya,    asmita,   raga,   dvesha\nand   abhinivesha. Of these, the last one refers to a\ndeep rooted clinging to the wrong self-identification\nwith the psychophysical being. This is the\nimpenetrable darkness that covers the soul at the time\nof death; when all other illusions of the world seem\nobliterated. This is referred to here, in the thirteenth\nname, as the dark-night destroyed by the sunrise of\nSelf-knowledge. The sunrise has another effect. It puts\nout the night-lilies of fond affections and strong\naddictions; i.e.    moha    and   maha-moha       (refer to name\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam          28                  January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\n14). In the twelfth name the analogy is reversed.          Moha\nbecome an attractive sensuality born out of the mud\nof worldliness. This is the non-discrimination        (aviveka)  ,\nspoken of as the first category of five     mohas. To remove\nthis  Shri Dakshinamurti        comes as the gentle cool\nmoon-shine of         viveka, developed through the\nsanyama       of the     yogi   (who according to the\nBhagavadgita, keeps awake in the night of\nworldliness). The most terrible of the five            mohas    is\nthe fourth -  Tamisra, arising out of anger. This is aptly\ncompared to the fire (see name 11). The               Smritkara\nsays, \"Dharma arises out of satya and grows through\ncompassionate giving. It is sustained by forbearance,\nbut is destroyed by the touch of krodha\". Bhagvadgita\nalso mentions      krodha   as the generator of       sammoha\nand the destroyer of the self. It is like a forest-\nconflagration that erupts suddenly from all sides and\nin a trice encircles the unsuspecting sadhaka, however\npure and secure he may be like King Parikshit. The\nonly succour here is an equally sudden shower of\ngrace, from the skies of satsanga, like the one that\ndescended on Parikshit in the form of Shuka.\n    Incidentally, Shukadeva and Vamadeva are two\nnames which scriptures identify with typical methods\nof God-realization. Yoga Vasishta says:\n  MegJeA 1/2e JeeceosJe 1/2e Uwmealeer ye'ieefveefce&les~  MegJeAes efJenbiece: OeesJeIlees JeeceosJe: efHeHeerefueJeAe~~\n    The downpour is a sudden or quick process; the\nsunrise or moonrise represents the slow path. That is\nhow we account for the various analogies used here\nin these four names. From another view-point, names\nthirteen and fourteen speak to the sun-path of action,\nthe  pravritti-marga     while names eleven and twelve\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         29                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ndescribe the nectarine course of internal\ncontemplation,      nivritti-marga.\n15)  YeJeIle%eeveeeqyOeMeerleebMeg:\n    Full moon to the ocean of devotees' knowledge.\n16)  YeJeIlee%eevele=Ceeveue:\n    The forest-fire that consumes the dry grass of the\ndevotees' ignorance.\n17)  YeJeIleebYeespemendeebMeg:\n    The radiant sun that makes the lotus of the\ndevotees' heart to bloom.\n18)  YeJeIleJesAefJeA-IeveeIeve:\n    The rain cloud to the peacock of the devotees' mind.\n19)  YeJeIleJewAjJejeJesAvoge\n    The full-moon that makes the devotee to bloom\nlike night-lily.\n20)  YeJeIleJeAesJeA-efoJeeJeAj:\n    He who appears to the devotees as the sun to the\nkoka   bird.\n    These six names are fashioned on the theme of\nDivine love, bhakti. As in the case of the subject of\nmoha   in the immediately preceding names, the theme\nis worked out through various analogies.\n    The first two names indicate how Shri\nDakshinamurti, whose only aim is to bestow the highest\nknowledge on the seeking soul, does it by using the\nbhakti  of the seeker. In the scriptures the enlightener\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam           30                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nis the Guru, and the Guru's teaching is the seed that\nis to be sown in the field of the seeking heart.\n             yeerpeb iegaHeosMeesefn efpe%eemeg: #es$eced G(r)3eles~\n    What makes the seeker a fit receptacle to the\nteaching, is the element of bhakti. It is the attitude of\nsupreme devotion which turns the enquiry                (efpe%eemee)\ninto a fertile land and not a dry desert of\nintellectualism. The forests and the seas are the\nexpressions of the earth's richness. Both are turned\ninto useful purpose by the trimming of the forests\nand turning of the tides. These two facts are deftly\nused to illustrate how the master accounts for the\nebb and flow of knowledge that lights the aspirant's\npath, and how he destroys the undesirable growth of\nincorrect knowledge, reducing them to ash and\ncharcoal that serve as manure to enrich the growth of\ncorrect knowledge. Two contrary processes of\ntenderness (moonlight) and ferocity         (fire) are initiated\nby the Lord in turning the aspirant's devotion into\nenlightenment.\n    Names seventeen and nineteen again provide a\ncontrast. In one, the devotee is a lotus sustained by\ndaylight, while in the other, he is a lily that blooms\nonly at night. By implication we understand two types\nof devotees, one responding to the dynamic touch and\nthe other sensitive to silent and subtle inspirations.\nApart from the fact that the physicality of day and\nnight have a direct and different impact on different\nsadhakas, the analogy may refer to two differently\noriented natures. The same Lord inspires both of\nthem, just as the same light that is in the sun becomes\nthe moon-shine also. We may take these two modes\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         31                 January 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nof light as referring to the    Shiva  and   Shakti  aspects of\nIshvara. This has a bearing upon the nature of the\nsadhana also, but like the lotus and lily they both\nshare the same definition of love, the same watery\ncontent as their sustaining base.\n    Names eighteen and twenty present another pair\nof devotees, in the form of two birds. Here again there\nis a lively contrast. The peacock is well-known for its\ncharacteristic vocal expression of joy at the coming of\nthe rain clouds. That is how a devotee responds to the\ngracious appearance of divine visitations. When they\nare not there, the devotee accepts it with faith and\nreconciliation and still celebrates the Lord's work. But\nthere are certain devotees who are intense like the\nKoka   bird (also called   Charvaka), which according to\nthe fable, literally drinks in the sunshine. Throughout\nthe night, it is afflicted by its soul-thirst and spends\nthe entire time waiting for light. Similarly, a devotee\nmay discard the solace of ordinary religious or other\nfulfillments and hanker for the Lord and Lord alone,\nand make Him appear through the mounting pressure\nof his pining.\n    We hear about the four-fold division of devotees -\narta,  jijnasu,   artharthi, and      jnani. The     Koka   bird\nbelongs to the first category and the peacock to the\nthird, while names fifteen and sixteen refer to the\nsecond category. Names seventeen and nineteen may\nbe considered to be the picturing of the          jnani.\n                                                     (Continued)\n                    (Courtesy : Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt.

Since they found the horse tied outside\nthe ashram, they thought that the great Sage was the culprit\nand began assaulting him.\n\nThe Sage awoke from his trance, and in anger, destroyed all\nthe sons of King Sagar who were attacking him.

The Sage relented and advised him that the only\nway to purify the souls of his ancestors, enabling them to\nattain nirvana, was by bringing the sacred river Ganga down\nfrom the heavens to bathe them. Anshuman and, thereafter,\nhis son Dilip, spent their lifetime in prayers and austerities for\nthat. After many years of consistent efforts, Bhagiratha, the\ngreat grandson of King Sagar, was able to appease Lord\nBrahma and he requested Him to flow the river Ganga down\nto Earth from heaven. Lord Brahma, being the creator of the\nworld, commanded Ganga to comply, which She could not\nrefuse. But She was displeased and angry, as She felt slighted.\n\nSo, in a rage, She flowed with Her full might and force, as She\nwanted to destroy Earth with Her immense power. Bhagiratha\nprayed to Lord Shiva for protection from the wrath of Ganga,\nas advised by Lord Brahma. To protect all creation and\nprevent it from getting washed away, Lord Shiva came\nbetween the flow of Ganga and Earth, entangling Her in His\nlocks. Ganga learnt Her mistake and prayed for pardon. Lord\nShiva released Ganga in seven different streams so that Earth\ncould handle the power of Ganga.

But if, among such topics,\nrebirth and the like must be taught from experience\nalone, is there any way, to do so by dying first to\ngain it? Hence, in matters beyond the powers of\nreason, it is necessary to accept trustworthy\nstatements as authority. Don't we refrain from taking\npoison on the authority of such statements without\ntesting them to obtain the experience?\nIt is not to be understood from this that reason\nshould be ignored altogether. It must be given due\nweight if only to scotch the evils arising in society\nfrom blind mistaken faith. Accordingly, the authority\nof reason and the Scriptures alike will be relied\nupon in dealing with today's subject.\nIs religion a mere matter of speculation? The\nquestion may be interpreted in two ways:\n(1) When strenuous efforts have proved fruitless,\nto believe, in order to soothe one's grief, that God\nO DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\nLet my Pranams be in my Deeds.\nTo offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n- Smt.

Bolangdy.\nRELIGION A MATTER FOR\nPRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE\n(Delivered at Karkala in May 1937, and\npublished in Kanara Saraswat in August 1937.)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 20237\nwill bestow the reward at least in a future birth, is\npure speculation; in other words, a mental attitude,\nassumed for the sake of mental peace, in the absence\nof any actual experience of God or of rebirth.\n(2) Intellectual perception of truths relating to\nGod and religion, is enough: practice is unnecessary.\nWhatsoever the practice, good will result from the\nmere fact that the mind is directed towards religion.\nThat neither of these contentions is sound will\nbe clear from the following explanations:\n(1) Says Manu (VI-67): \"If dirty water has to be\npurified, it is absolutely no use calling the clearing\nnut aloud times without number. The water is\nrendered pure only when the nut is actually obtained\nand put into it. Similarly, the fruits of religion can\nbe obtained only by practising it.\" This disposes of\nthe first contention.\n(2) Says Sureshvaracharya ( Naishkarmyasiddhi,\nIV-62): \"If the wise may be wicked, what is the\ndifference between dogs and such wise men?\" Again,\nas the Upanishads put it, \"He who does not leave\nwickedness aside cannot attain salvation from the\nknowledge of Brahman.\" Hence the second\ncontention also falls to the ground.\nIt follows from the above that religion is not a\nmatter of speculation alone, but a matter for practice.\nWhether it is also a matter for experience will now\nbe considered.\nThe religious doctrine of rebirth has been\nestablished in the Gita and the Upanishads. Gautama\nmaintains that it is a result of the habit of previous\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 20238\nbirths that the new-born calf seeks its mother's\nteats straightway to have its fill of milk and does not\nsearch for it elsewhere; as also the fact the cow is\nfrightened at the very sight of the tiger, realising\nthat it is her mortal foe. According to the Patanjali\nYogasutras (III-18), a particular type of yogasadhana\nenables one to recall past births. It may therefore be\ninferred that rebirth is a matter capable of being\ntested by experience.\nSimilary, the Patanjali Yogasutras themselves (II-\n44) hold that a study of the Scriptures enables one\nto realise the Ishtadevata. It may be understood\nfrom this that the gods too are not outside the scope\nof human experience.\nAgain, the Upanishads declare that the ultimate\ngoal of religion, namely, the attainment of the Self,\nis possible through intense meditation. Even the\nParabrahman, then is an object capable of being\nrealised. Yajnyavalkya too (1-8) accepts this.\nOn the whole, it is clear that religion is not a\nmatter of mere speculation but definitely one for\npractice and experience.\nThe utility of such a religion will now be briefly\nexplained, althought the question is not strictly\nrelevant to the subject in hand.\nThat the well-being of society must rest on a\nfoundation of ethics, is a proposition which few will\ndeny. But ethical truths will not easily sprout in\nselfish hearts unless there is a religious feeling.\nUniversal religious truths are not dissociated from\nethics. Manu says (X-63) that harmlessness, truth,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 20239\nuprightness, purity and self-control should be\npractised by all alike. Is it necessary to add that\nreligious tenets embodying such ethical teaching\nare a source of the society's well-being? \"It is the\nfunction of religion to support the subjects and save\nthem from a fall,\" says Vyasa. The injunctions against\nthe satisfaction of the sexual instinct otherwise than\nthrough a wedded life, as also against the eating of\nflesh and the drinking of liquor otherwise than as\nprescribed in connection with laborious sacrifices,\nwere doubtless meant to regulate man's natural\npropensities in an orderly fashion. According to the\nBhagavata (VI-5-41), \"The element of evil in the\nobjects of sense cannot be appreciated without\nexperience. Hence the man who adopts the life of\nthe householder, experiences sorrow in due course\nfrom such objects, acquires dispassion, and adopts\nthe path of nivritti \", the path that leads to ultimate\ngood. Of the four ashramas, brahmacharya,\nvanaprastha and sanyas obviously follow this path,\nwhile even that of grihastha may be said to follow it\nto a large extent, being strictly regulated in various\nways, for example, the prohibition of sexual\nintercourse except at prescribed periods.\n\"The Paramatman who is in all is One and to\nworship Him is the eternal religion.\" A feeling of this\nkind is a great help in the observance of tenets\nregarding harmlessness etc. Again, \"Just as different\nrivers join the one ocean, the different faiths leads\nto the One Paramatman,\" indicating that a tolerant\nattitude towards other religions can result in nothing\nbut good.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202310","type":"Document"}

That is why we are here today. You\nhave arranged many programmes of music etc., but\nwhat pleased us most was Kilpady Gurudutt's address\nwherein he spoke on Sampradaya, March First etc. We\ntoo have never asked anyone to give up what has been\nhanded down by our elders and go entirely modern. As\nGurudutt said, all we have asked is : do not develop\nthick heads, reflect on what you have heard and\nwhat you are pr actising. It makes little difference\nwhether you take cow's milk or buffalo milk. Likewise,\nif you are repeating Gayatri Mantra, do not merely be\ncontent with the repetition, go deep into the meaning\nof this Mantra. If we were to preach Dharma, people\nwould find it difficult in the context of present-day\nconditions. So, we have to devise new ways of teaching\nthe people according to their ability to grasp and\nunderstand, just as you offer a child a chocolate to\ninduce him to take cough mixture. So, also, first we\nhave to win the confidence of the listeners and then\nconvey to them whatever Dharmik teachings we want\nto teach them. That is why, we always say - it doesn't\nmatter if you have many new ideas or go by new paths,\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\nIMPOR TANCE OF  MARCH FIRST\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202311\nwhat matters is, with the intelligence given to you by\nGod, how much of our ancient truths you are able to\nimbibe.\nAs we said, Gurudutt spoke of the importance of\nMarch First and stressed the importance of following\nthe Guru. The Vedas tell us that the Guru's feet are\nholy, because they show us the path by which one\nmust tread. But, it is not enough  to worship the\nGuru's feet, you must also follow those feet, you\nmust walk by the path by which the Guru's feet\nhave walked showing you the way. That is why the\nGuru's feet are worshipped more than any other\npart of his sacred person. They are our guides and\nour pathfinders. That is why, We said: March first .\nGod is there, Guru is there and Sadhana Shakti is\nalso there. We are moving ahead and, if you all\nfollow us, you will not be sorry.\nWe do not ask you to accept everything blindly.\nReflect on what we have said, on what the elders\nhave said and accept it only if you firmly believe in\nit. Man is always in search of happiness. In our\naddress at Matunga, we had said that one's Sadhana\nshould not consist only of bookish knowledge read\nand acquired by him. He should also have mental\nSadhana which is the real Sadhana. We should\ninstal God in our mind, think of Him always and\nworship Him in our mind. Nobody is wholly free\nfrom the entanglements of Sansar. Our elders tell\nus in the scriptures repeatedly \"wake up, wake up.\"\nWhen you have to wake up a child in the morning,\nit is not enough to just tell him to wake up, he will\nnot get up. You have to shake him repeatedly, telling\nhim to wake up. Similarly, our scriptures tell us :\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202312\npevce og:Keb peje og:Keb ce=l3ego&g:Keb Hegve:Hegve: ~\nmebmeej meeiejs og:Keb lemceeled peeie=efn peeie=efn ~~\nThat is the meaning of the repeated emphasis on\n'peeie=efn peeie=efn\".\nAll of us can attain eternal happiness, but most\nof us do not attain it. Why? It is because our vision\nis veiled by the pall of sorrow. Happiness is of two\nkinds, one is the shadow, the other the substance,\none the unreal and the other the real happiness.\nWe are too busy chasing the shadows of happiness\nin our pursuit of wordly pleasures to bother about\nreal happiness. We are seeking happiness outside,\nforgetting its source within us. We have spoken at\nseveral places of the Sport of Brahman, how this\ncreation came into being. The Brahman we refer to\nhere is different from the Brahma of the Trinity\n(Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar). He is the\nSupreme Being, the Primordial Being. He is without\nbeginning and without end, without name or form.\nThat Supreme Being felt like having divine Sport-\nLeela, So Brahman created what we might call a\nsplit personality, called Adi Shakti. That Shakti\ndeliberated deeply why She was created and realised\nthat Brahman wanted to have divine sport and that\nShe must carry out His wishes. So, She, in turn\ncreated Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar and\nassigned them the three respective functions of\ncreation, preservation and destruction. The same\nShakti or divine power pervades all the three\nfunctions. The same Shakti has been carrying on\nthis Leela all the while till now and will continue to\ndo so in future as well. That is what the Shastras\nhave always told us, but to explain it in simpler\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202313\nterms : a man wakes up, carries on his daily routine\nand then goes to sleep again at the end of the day.\nThese three functions represent creation,\npreservation and destruction and while carrying out\nall the three, the same Shakti works through every\nindividual. So, Shakti is at work in every living\ncreature and all over the world. Such a Shakti can\nbe realised by us in many ways such as Jnana,\nKarma or Bhakti paths. If we look upon Her as the\nDivine Mother and surrender ourselves to Her,\nplacing ourselves at Her feet, She sheds her veil of\nMaya and reveals Herself to us as Adi Shakti Herself\nand liberates us from the coils of a mortal existence.\nWe all have our worldly goals, our mundane aims\nand ends and in their pursuit we allow this precious\nhuman life to be frittered away.\nBut, we should realise once and for all that we\nare not here merely to work out the effects of our\npast actions or sow seeds of new actions but to\nrealise the true purpose of our life, namely, to\nliberate ourselves and attain eternal happiness. In\nother words, we came from Shiva originally but,\nforgetting this fact, we have become \"Shava\" or\nmortal. We must now go back to our original state\nin Shiva.\n(Summary of the ashirvachan delivered\nat B engaluru on 26-1-1976 )\nLEST WE FORGET\nP. P.

But before that we have\nto gaze, and this gazing does not end. It continues\nthrough all the strengthening and waning of the\nrelationship between the Divine and the soul. Rather,\nthis gazing deepens further and sustains even in\nthe aftermath of realisation. Perhaps this is the only\nthing a Jivan Mukta does -- just sit and gaze.\nWhat he gazes at are the elements, the face of\nthe beautiful that never gets scarred. The elements\nalso change, but every change is an improvisation of\nbeauty, whereas what is mortal, what is finite will\nshudder at every touch of time. The fact remains:\nBirth, death, old age, disease, misery-- are all that we\ncan see in a finite thing.\nTurn your gaze form the apparent to the\nunderlying, unchanging reality. Then you will see\nthe Birthless ( Ajanma), Deathless ( Amrutyu), Ageless\n(Ajara) reality. This reality will sustain you through\nthe tribulations of life. The more troublesome life is,\nthe more glorious the relationship will be.\nThat is why we practise gazing at the picture of\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202323\nthe divine, this beautiful Jagat Chitram, which the\nDivine Painter has painted with the substanceless\ncolour of his own raga, with the unseen brush on\nthe canvas of his own existence.

The stpes come, one\nby one, because an intense eagerness or aspiration\nawakens. We cannot stop now. We have to begin\nnow, with Karma, action. But it should be Tat\nKarma. Om Tat Sat  are all names of Brahman. The\nfirst meaning of Tat Karma  is they are the deeds\nwhich have been commanded by the Shastras and\nrecommended or prescribed for the good of the\nsoul.\nIn the spiritual field, Dharma is a well-designed\ntechnical means which the Master Engineer has\ndesigned. It looks so elaborate, sometimes\nburdensome. But every element of dharma, every\nduty ( kartavya), is designed in such a way as to\ndistribute the stresses of life. To disregard this\nengineering will be a calamity. A perfect design can\nnever fail.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202324\nShastriya Karma\nFollowing the spiritual laws, consciously or\nunconsciously, you gain a clarity and strength to\nface the realities of life. This is the relevance of\nShastriya karma.\nShastriya karma gives you two important results:\nit gives you strength of a spiritual character; it opens\nup chances to create new fields for new powers to\nbe awakened. Your emotions, ideas and aspirations\nneed channels. Karma channels them.\nThen karma creats new fields for greater emotions.\nIf such a process is not followed, everything becomes\na burden, this very body becomes a burden. You\nneed the faith that this is the work of the Lord.\nFaith enables you to meet sorrows with dignity,\nstrengthening you and lifting you up.\nTherefore, Tat karma is that action which brings\nmaturity to you, which takes you towards God. In\nkarma, you are tested for the strength you have\ngained, not for your achievements. In Karma Yoga,\none is ready to lay down the work any moment and\ngo ahead in peace.\nAttentive Silence\nAct in such a way that you can discard the act\nand still be quite intact any moment. That is the test\nof acting in and for God. This is the quality of a\ndedicated act, attentive silence. Silence is nothing\nbut an elimination of all other attentions; and\nattention is nothing but a concentration of that\nsilence, of bringing it to such a focus that it bursts\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202325\nout in the revelation of a Divine message. If this\nsilence and this attention can come into your work,\nthen it is Karma Yoga . All other actions are\nbondages.\nActivity, to be meaningful, should have a purpose.\nEvery achievement is a cessation of activity, and\nhence a form of repose. In an ocean, the waves will\never be rising and falling in its vastness! These Tat\nkarmas are divine actions. Here the tendency to act\nis an impulse of the ocean's greatness and hence is\na song of Divine glory. This alone is working for God.\nHere the working is itself the fulfilment.\nExpression of Ego\nAll physical noise means only an expression of\nego. There is no silent action because of the ego.\nSuch an activity is definitely not Tat karma . To\nmaintain activity in silence, every act must tend to\nreduce the ego and strengthen the spirit. Then we\ncan enter into the reality of the Truth and be\nestablished there.\nThis is the ultimate in the strengthening of the\nspirit. How this is done is told in the latter half of\nthe verse: ( ekena) singly, ( dvabhyam) by the double\neffort, (tribhih) by the triple method and ( ashtabhih)\nby the eight-fold path. All these methods are open\nto us. We will see in the next chapter how all these\ncan be integrated into the one path, that is Samvit\nSadhana .\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt.

What we should do is to see that only good things\nare done by us. So don't look back; think only of the present\nand shape your life accordingly.\"\nParama Pujya Shrimat Parijnanashram Swamiji III\nIt was a crisp February morning at Chetak Riding Academy. At\nthe crack of dawn, Vajra, the youngest colt at the academy,\nstepped out of his stall, led by his caretaker . It was his first day of\nriding with the academy students. As he walked proudly across\nthe stable, his friends cheered him on. Vajra could hear his\ntrainer's voice at a distance, and his heart pounded with\nexcitement. He had watched Amma and the other horses train\nfor hours with the students. He had heard so many stories about\ntheir numerous friends that he could not wait to make friends of\nhis own!\nAs he approached the training pen, he could hear the chatter of\nchildren nearby. They seemed to be just as excited as he was!\nWhile Vajra waited in sweet anticipation of the journey ahead,\nhis glistening black coat caught the attention of a sprightly\nyoung boy, and he dashed towards Vajra. As he proceeded to\npat Vajra's head, he squealed in excitement. Unaccustomed to\nchildren and caught completely unawares, Vajra leapt forward\nout of sheer fright. The ensuing commotion forced the trainer\nto abort Vajra's training session.\n  Vajra takes on the world!\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202342\nVajra returned to his stall in utter disbelief. What an\nanticlimactic end to what should have been the most glorious\nevent of his life! Vajra was startled by the unexpected turn of\nevents. The enquiries of his friends agitated him further, and he\nstomped the ground indignantly. Amma tried to calm him\ndown, but Vajra was not in a receptive mood. Unfortunately for\nVajra, his caretaker decided that he needed some disciplining.\nNot one to give up without a fight, Vajra stood his ground.\nWord soon sp read around and everyone at the academy\nbranded him unruly. What is worse, poor Vajra started believing\nthem. For days, he watched as his friends were led to the\ntraining pen for their riding lessons while he remained confined\nto his stall. When they returned, they eagerly exchanged stories\nof their experiences. The more he heard them, the more he\nlonged to be out there, training with the children.\nUnfortunately, it seemed like an impossible dream now. Vajra's\ntrainer tried to work on him, but to no avail. It seemed like Vajra\nhad given up on himself.\nOne evening, when Amma\nreturned to the stable, she\nfound Vajra sulking in the\ncorner . He had not eaten all\nday.\n\"What is the matter, Vajra?\"\nshe asked softly.\n\"I wanted to be every child's\nfavourite horse, Amma. As it\nturns out, I am just the unruly\none,\" said Vajra ruefully.\n \"It was an honest mistake,\nmy child. The boy approached you from your blind spot and\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202343\nstartled you,\" Amma consoled Vajra.\n\"But I behaved so awfully after that,\" he countered.\n\"Yes, you sure did. You made a bad choice in a fit of anger. We all\nmake mistakes, dear, but our mistakes do not define us. What\ndefines us is how we deal with our mistakes. Instead of brooding\nover them, we must learn from them and grow!\" said Amma.\nAs Amma continued to explain, Vajra listened attentively and\nabsorbed every word of what she said. He silently resolved to\nstart afresh and not stop until he had achieved his goal. The next\nday, he woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to take on\nthe world.\nWhy was Vajra sent to the stable in disgrace?\nBecause he was 'horsing' around!\nWhy didn't Vajra sing at the concert?\nBecause his throat was a bit 'hoarse'!\nWhy is Vajra twice as bad as you when he has a sore\nthroat?\nBecause he is a hoarse horse!!!!!\nWhat is Vajra's favourite\ngame?\nStable Tennis!\nWho lived next door to\nVajra?\nHis  'NEIGH'bour!\nRiddle Time:Horsing around!\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202344\n*\n*\n3.\n5.\n6.\nWhat is the difference between Vajra and Varsha\n(rain)?\nVajra is reigned up - Varsha rains down!!!\nWhat kind of horses roam at nights?\nNightmares!\n1.

He became an\nepitome of loyalty, bravery and courage.\nChetak was from the indigenous Marwari breed of horses,\ncharacterised by their inward turned ears, short stature,\nelegance, grace, beauty, speed, sturdiness and spirit. He was\ncalled Mayur greeva, neck like a peacock, stood at 14.2 - 15.2\nhands height, (short compared to Arabian horses), a very dark\nblack colour which appeared tinted with blue, Eloquent\nshining eyes and aggressive nature. Legend says that Chetak\nchose Maharana Pratap as his master by allowing him to ride,\nforging a bond for life.\nSwift as the wind and as brave as his master, Chetak had\nfought many battles with the Maharana, even carrying him to\nsafety when required. Those were the times when the\nRajputs had to fend off the Mughals and incursions from\nCentral Asian tribes while fighting devious battles amongst\nthemselves. It should be\nremembered that it was\nMaharana Pratap 's father,\nMaharana Udai Singh who\nhad been rescued by Panna\ndhai at the cost of sacrificing\nher own son.\nChetak died at Haldighati on\n18 June 1576, in a battle\nagainst emperor Akbar. The\nemperor 's army under the\nleadership of Maharaja Man\nSingh, intended to attack\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202346\nand capture Mewar from the western front. When Maharana\nPratap came to know, he marshaled his armies at Haldighati, a\nnarrow pass in the Aravalli range at Rajasthan. A fierce battle\nensued. Chetak reared up and planted his hooves on\nMaharaja Man Singh 's elephant while Maharana Pratap\nthrew his spear at the adversary. In the twists and turns of\nbattle maneuvers, the Mahout of the elephant died as the\nspear struck a deadly blow. The elephant gorged Chetak's leg\nwith its massive trunk.\nEven in that condition, Chetak escaped with the Maharana\nand took him to safety. It jumped over a 25 feet deep river\nwith a broken leg to protect his friend, the king. Chetak\nsuccumbed to his injuries and died on the spot, while the\ntearful Maharana bid a fond farewell.\nThe king lived to fight another day, where he continued to\nbattle for the safety and protection of his people. Eventually,\nhe was able to recover and defend most of his lost Empire.\nLegend says that Akbar shed a tear for the bravery of\nMaharana Pratap at his death, so valiant was he.\nA legend in his lifetime, the heritage of Chetak continues in\nfolklore and poetry. His bravery and loyalty have been\nimmortalized in a poem by Shyam Narayan Pandey, called\n\"Chetak ki Veerta\"\njCe yeer(r)e (r)eewJeA[]er Yej-Yej JeAj\n(r)esleJeA yeve ie3ee efvejeuee Lee\njeCeeOeleeHe JesA Ieesae[s mes\nHeae[ ie3ee nJee JeAe Heeuee Lee\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam March 202347\nLONG AGO:  Horses in ancient India\nActivity Time: Bandhanwar\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nThere are repeated references to\nthe horse the  (c. 1500 - 500\nBC), especially the .\nThe Ashvins are divine twins\nnamed for their horsemanship.\nSurya Dev rides a chariot pulled by\nseven magnificent horses,\nma rs h al ed  b y Ar u na ,  th e\ncharioteer\nHayagriva, an   of Lord\nVishnu, is depicted with a horse's\nhead and is worshipped for\nwisdom and knowledge.\n Uchchaihshravas was the first\nhorse to emerge from the depths\nof the ocean during\n.

He\ninvited Swamiji to honour us with His stay on his\nreturn journey but added hesitantly, \"There are\nrumours that transfers will take place soon but I\nhope orders won't come for some more time,\" Swamiji\nsmilingly quipped \"You need have no worry on that\nscore. We will come and stay at yours on our way\nback. Things don't move that fast in government.deg\nWe were then living in the government bungalow of\nDisttrict Medical Officer. It was a large one and the\nfirst floor which was unused was readied for Swamiji's\nstay.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202421\nA few weeks later, Swamiji with His retinue and\na few Bhanap families came to Madurai. Swamiji\nwas received with due honours. There was festivity\nin the air for the next three days. His divine presence\nand the Pujas to Lord Bhavanishankar, infused\ndivinity and elevated the whole atmosphere of the\nplace.\nMy father took Swamiji to Algerkoil, the\nMeenakshi Temple and to Tirupurankuram, where\nthere is a cave temple.\nOn the eve of Swamiji's departure the hall upstairs\nwas packed with people and Puja of Lord\nBhavanishankar was being performed. Suddenly\nthere was a bustle and all heads turned to see the\nintruder, our dog Soma, who went bouncing and\nstood very close to the bhatji, its face reflecting joy\nand merriment, tail wagging vigorously, looking at\nSwamiji and others.\nMy father's face froze with fear and\nembarrassment, lest Soma's unclean presence mar\nthe Puja rituals.\nSwamiji immediately sensed my father's\ndiscomfiture and said reassuringly 'when Lord\nDattatraya's Puja is going on, who should come\nbut His devotee!' This remark eased my father's\nanxiety at once.\nThis small incident shows how compassionate,\nbroad minded and understanding our Swamiji was.\n(First published in Sunbeam, June - July 2002)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

We, too, have felt like speaking on\nsomething different from what we have spoken\nelsewhere. As you all know, wherever we have gone,\nwe have been speaking on the Path of Devotion\n(Bhakti Marg). Today, we want to share our innermost\nthoughts with you. The Mathadhipati or Dharma\nGuru is there for the welfare of the devotee and\nbetterment of the people, to teach them how to walk\non the Path of Dharma. Each one has his own\nDharma, according to the time and clime and the\naspirant's own preparedness.\nOur scriptures are not like any ordinary reports.\nOur Vedas and Smritis tell us that whatever each\nand everyone adopts as a way of life, as a conduct\nfor himself, according to the time and the clime and\nhis own individual needs, itself constitutes Dharma\nfor him. The scriptures tell us to observe Dharma.\nThey tell us that Dharma is for the betterment of\nthe people. Just as a mother or father strives for the\nbetterment of their children, by telling the children\nwhat is good for them and what is not, so also our\nVedas and Smritis tell us how to shape our lives.\nHaving attained this human birth, we have to attain\nEternal Happiness, that is realise our Self. This is\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\n(Summary of the Ashirvachan delivered by\nHis Holiness at Dadar Sabha on 28-12-1975)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202423\nthe primary objective before the Vedas and Smritis\nand we must bear this in mind always.\nWhy are people asked to pursue the path of\nDharma? The scriptures tell us through beautiful\nShlokas how we can put our lives to the best possible\nuse for both social and spiritual purposes. Our\nancients have explained beautifully that we should,\nfirstly, have faith in Vedas and Smritis, that we\nshould worship `sajjan' people or persons who are\nspiritually-inclined. These are the great souls who\nhave realised, for themselves, the true purpose of\nlife, who have realised that we all are one, irrespective\nof our caste, creed, community, race and country.\nSuch people see all alike and their goal in life is to\nstrive for the betterment of humanity by seeing God\nin all as all.\nYou must have heard of 'Guru Parampara Charitra'\nby Umabai Arur which recites the glories of our\nSadgurus. This is a truly inspired work which she\nwas prompted to do by the Lord.  It tells us what\neach of our Gurus did for the community, starting\nfrom Adi Parijnanashram Swamiji. Swami\nParijnanashram-I used to strive for the welfare and\nwellbeing of the community, telling people what to\ndo and what not to do. This Charitra should be read\nwith due reverence.  It tells us also of the suffering\nto which each of our Gurus was subjected. In the\ncase of Srimad  Shankarashram-I, even though our\ncommunity then was small, many of our people did\nnot even know that He was our Guru and He had\nto introduce Himself that He was their Guru! Shri\nShankarashram attained Samadhi without any formal\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202424\nadoption of a Shishya but our community elders\nremembered that there was a disciple ordained by\nHim at Kollur and they went and begged him to\ntake over, because the Nagar rulers were again\nharassing the Saraswats for not having a Guru. Thus,\nSrimad Parijnanashram II was brought from Kallur\nand installed on the Peetha as our Guru.\nThe Guru Parampara Charitra teaches us that\nwhen we adopt someone as our Guru, He takes over\nour affairs and looks after us to His last breath.\nWhen Srimad Shankarashram II became our Guru,\nthere was miracle at Mallapur. Swamiji was fond of\nconjee and once, on the 'Sarnaradhana' day of His\nGuru, the people forgot to serve Him conjee. Then,\nthey found that the fire would simply not radiate\nany heat and the vode' could not be fried. When\nthey brought this matter to the attention of\nShankarashram Swamiji, the latter is said to have\nobserved \"How can that fire burn when the fire in\nour stomach is not quenched\". This parable has a\nlesson for us. When you have accepted someone as\nyour Guru, He becomes your preceptor and protector\nall your life. How can you ignore such a Guru in\ncarrying out ritualistic worship? In Swami\nVamanshram's time, the community elders became\nbold enough to accuse the Guru of\n'maladministration' and demanded that He turn over\nthe keys to the Shishya Swami (Krishnashram\nSwamiji). Vamanashram Swamiji flung the keys away\nand prayed to the Goddess to relieve Him of this life.\nThis incident also teaches us that once you have\naccepted a Guru, you must trust Him to do the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202425\nbest thing for you. He knows what is good for you\nand what is not. The Gun also knows what is the\nbest thing necessary for the Math. You must allow\nHim to carry out His will and should not try to\ninterfere by telling the Guru what He should do\nand how.\nWe all have taken human birth in order to attain\nTruth. We should first of all realise that we are here\non this earth because of God's will and that we have\nto go somewhere from here. The Guru is there to\nwork for the welfare of the society but, at the same\ntime, it is not for society to dictate to the Guru,\ntelling Him what He should do and how. We\nremember at Shirali, a man came to Anandashram\nSwamiji and sought His permission and His blessing\nfor marriage within the same Gotra (sa-gotra). Swamiji\ngave the permission saying that the restriction on\nsa-gotra marriages might have been laid down by\nour ancients at a time when our commuinity was\nvery small and not to have inter-mingling of the\nsame blood.\nWe do not seek any good for ourselves, we want\nonly the good of the community.

Some are by nature critical. Others\nunquestioningly accept whatever they are told. In\nthe passage just quoted, the former see a conflict\nbetween man's nature and free will. Even if a man\nout of his free will resolves not to do a thing, if his\nnature will make him do it, is there any scope for\nethical preaching or right conduct? And how can he\nbe held responsible for his deeds?\n    According to our Dharma, there are three factors\ngoverning all action, namely, free will, karma and\nthe divine will. There is a school of thought based\nsolely on free will. It discards the theory of previous\nbirths. But we discern a relationship of cause and\neffect in everything in this world. We have to presume\nthe existence of a primary cause for all phenomena\nincluding  the  differences  between  the  different\nthings or beings we meet with. The hypothesis of\nprevious  births  and  the  theory  of  karma  help  to\n\n          O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt. Uma & Shri Arun S. Bolangdy.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                          August  20234\n------- PAGE END -------\nexplain such differences satisfactorily. Every\nindividual soul acquires certain experiences and\nbecomes endowed with certain tendencies as a result\nof what it passes through in each of its births, and\nit is only the next natural and logical step to believe\nthat the nature of each such soul will be influenced\nby the stock of experiences and tendencies thus\nacquired.\n    We are also forced to the conclusion of the\nexistence of a Being governing the universe. We see\nvarious laws operating in the universe. There must\ntherefore be a Being responsible for those laws. This\nBeing is called Ishavara in our Dharma. Such a\nBeing cannot but have a will of Its own. This was\nwhat we meant when we referred to the divine will.\n    There is also a school of thought which accepts\nthe theory of the divine will as the sole factor in the\nuniverse. But such a theory is also open to objection.\nWe see that some are happy, while others are not.\nIs it not injustice? Does it not indicate partiality?\nAnd what may be the reasons for such difference of\ntreatment? Another objection is that acceptance of\nthe theory will engender a thoroughly helpless and\nslavish mentality.\n    The acceptance of the karma theory alone as the\nsole factor is similarly open to objection. If what we\nnow see is solely the result of past deeds, how can\nwe account for the variations in the past deeds of\ndifferent individuals, which are now manifesting\ndifferent results?\n    We cannot therefore accept any one of the three\nfactors as the sole one. We have to assume the\nexistence and operation of all three of them. Some\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        5                 August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nconflict may perhaps be apparent amongst them.\nWe have to resolve it. Let us see what our Scriptures\nsay.\n   According to the Koushitaki Upanishad,\n\"Whomsoever the Lord decides to lift upwards, by\nhim He causes good deeds to be performed.\nWhomsoever He resolves to push down, by him He\ncauses bad deeds to be performed?\" (Ill-9). On the\nother hand, the Brihadaranyakopanishad says : \"Man\nis full of desire. His inclinations will be shaped by\nhis desires. His deeds will be shaped by his\ninclinations. And he will reap the fruit suited to his\ndeeds.\" (IV-4 & 5). While the former passage gives\nprominence to the divine will, the latter makes the\nindividual's desires the cause of whatever good or\nevil befalls him.\n   In the Gita, Shri Krishna, persuading Arjuna to\nfight and kill his foes, goes to the length of saying:\n\"By me they are already overcome. Be thou the\noutward cause, 0 dexterous one?\" (XI-33). Here also,\nthe divine will seems to be made almost the one\nfactor which counts. This is emphasised again in\nanother verse \"The Lord dwelleth in the hearts of all\nbeings. O Arjuna, by his Maya causing all beings to\nrevolve as though mounted on a machine.\" (XVIII-6l).\nThis immediately follows the verse quoted at the\nbeginning. Thus in two successive verses, prominence\nhas been given to nature and to divine will\nrespectively. We should not therefore regard the two\nviews as contradictory, but as supplementary and\nmeant to lead to a single conclusion, namely, the\nneed for doing one's duty.\n   The Gita has passages pointing to free will also\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        6                 August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\n\"Let the self be raised by itself; let not the self be\nallowed to be depressed. The self alone is the friend\nof itself, and the self alone its enemy. To him that\nbath conquered himself, the self is his friend. But\nto him that bath not so conquered, the self is his\nenemy.\" (VI-5 & 6). This is further proof of the fact\nthat, in order to drive home the same lesson to\nArjuna, Shri Krishna has advanced different\narguments at different times.\n    A man's nature, as we have stated already, is\nbuilt upon the stock of experiences and tendencies\nacquired by him as a result of his previous births.\nThis is called prarabdha. It is the stock of his previous\nkarma with which he starts a new birth. But it does\nnot stand in the way of his doing any good deeds\nin the course of that new birth. As a result of the\nnature developed in human beings, some have\nleanings towards good and some towards evil. This\nnature is of three broad types, satvic, rajasic and\ntamasic, and a detailed description of these will be\nfound in Chapters XVII and XVIII of the Gita. Chapter\nXVI sets out the attributes of the divine nature and\nits opposite.\n    As a result of deeds performed in previous births,\nman is born in a particular grade or class of society.\nSuch grades have been broadly classified into four\nmain types, namely, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya\nand Shudra, and the main characteristics pertaining\nto each of these types have been mentioned in the\nGita (XVIII-42 to 44). They constitute, so to say, the\ntype of mentality of the individuals born in the\nrespective classes. Within the limits marked out by\na person's nature, there will be enough freedom left\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         7                 August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nto him to do good deeds or bad deeds according to\nhis discretion. When this is understood, it will be\nseen that a man's nature or karma need not stand\nin the way of his doing or not doing any particular\nthing. Even nature can be gradually changed by\nconstant, earnest, sedulous endeavour.\n    This view may not appear correct at rust. Shri\nKrishna Himself has raised the question in the Cites\n\"Even the man of knowledge behaves in conformity\nwith his own nature; beings follows nature; what\nshall restraint avail?\" (III-33). If restraint be of no\navail, will preaching be of any avail? But in the very\nnext verse, the Lord says \"Affection and aversion for\nthe objects of sense abide in the senses; let none\ncome under the dominion of these two they are\nobstructors of the path.\" So we have His authoritative\npronouncement that to submit or not to submit\nrests with ourselves.\n    It is stated in the Yajnyavalkya Smriti that success\nis achieved by both claim (purva karma) and pourusha\nacting in cooperation.      God helps those who help\nthemselves.     What is required is sustained exertion\nin the proper direction. If it is maintained that God\ndoes everything and that man has no freedom in\nany matter, it would be ascribing to God both cruelty\nand partiality. Hence the Brahmasutras declare that\nGod distributes rewards strictly according to deserts\nand merit (II-1-34). From this it is clear that there\nis scope for doing good deeds out of one's own free\nwill.\n    In doing good deeds, we may have to select such\ndeeds as  are in conformity with our nature, suited\nto our status, condition and circumstances in life.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         8                 August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nPlace, time and occasion must also be taken into\naccount. We have to follow the line of least resistance.\nGoing  against  the  current  is  more  difficult  than\ngoing with it. But even when going with the current,\nwe need not be mere passive agents : we do have\nsome freedom to do what good we can. Sometime,\nperhaps, we may, with extraordinary effort, succeed\nin  going,  at  least  for  some  distance,  against  the\ncurrent. Even so, evil can be resisted or fought with\neffort.  In  certain  conditions,  we  may  well  take\nadvantage  of  our  very  nature  for  doing  good.  In\ncertain others, we may get the better of our nature\nand do good.\n    Thus nature, the divine will and the human\nwill can all be made to co-operate with one another.\nNone of them operates to the complete exclusion\nof the other two.\n    May  Providence  grant  you  the  ability  and  the\nunderstanding to grasp this problem aright, to resolve\nthe apparent conflict satisfactorily, and to do good in\nspite of the obstacles in your way!\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                          August  20239\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Mind and speech. Vak is a\nspecific concept dealt within the Vedas. At the\npersonal level, I need to bring in a balance between\nmind and speech. And I see - if my mind is\nagitated, should anyone's mind be agitated, should\none receive some unexpected news, then the\nrhythm between inhalation and exhalation goes\nhaywire. So, if I am in control of my inhalation and\nexhalation, I will be able to control my mind. That\nis, at one level, the result of Pranayam. But it can\nbe taken to another level - I can bring so much\nvitality to my inhalation and exhalation, that my\nentire body benefits. At a deeper level, inhalation\nand exhalation affect speech. Can anyone speak\nwithout taking a breath? A fearful man- \"What shall\nI do?\"- This is how he speaks. When afraid or\nanxious, the breathing process and speech, both go\nfor a toss. So the breathing process must first be\nmade strong and steady, and then the speech. If\nthis cannot be done at all times, let us, at first,\natleast do this when singing. Alright? Here, I have\nset the Samvit Sadhaka as the ideal. For the\nSaraswats, Samvit Sadhakas are the ones to look\nup to. They sing with such gusto! It is really\nenjoyable!

He finds it meaningless to use\nthat precious strength to achieve some worldly goal,\nwhich has been invoked by the Guru's Grace. The\nShishya knows that Guru is the repository of\nstrength and hence the better he learns to realize\nthis and manifest that Gurushakti in his life to that\nextent he experiences gradually an increasing\npeace, balance and strength of mind. This is a\ntreasure to revel in, and he does not wish to\ndissipate it by instant use.

How do we perform this\npuja?\n    By following the injunctions of the Shastras in\noffering proper service and honour to God.\n    Generally, in pujas, we offer particularly fragrant\nflowers, special perfumes, and a variety of eatables.\nHaving offered them, we derive a sense of satisfaction\nthat we have done well.\n    But, truly, above all else, there is only one thing\nthat we need to submit to God.          That is our mind, Only\nby surrendering this, can we hope to benefit Without\ngiving the mind, no amount of other offerings will make\nthe puja complete.\n    But what do we mean by surrendering the mind?

The straightest path that takes you\ndirect to revelation is the one stroke - \"Ekena\". It is\none step, and in that moment of realization you\nhave the entire path, which the soul has been\ntraversing through endless births brought to a\nfulfilment.\n   The Upanishad calls the experience of Truth not\na realization but a 'recognition', an awakening of\nSelf-knowledge that is in you. The whole world is a\nmoment's flashing up, from the Divine's viewpoint.\nOnly very rare souls are able to deal with this one\nstroke and cutting through the ego. So, we fall back\nupon something more than one stroke.\nIshwara and Guru\n   The Upanishad gives us two more concepts along\nwith the Atman, i.e. Ishvara and Guru. This is\ndvabhyam, the two props to scale mountains of\nobstacles on the path of atma vichara.\n   The taking up of the two fold path simultaneously\nis a particular specialty of the Shvetashvatara\nUpanishad. The concept of Ishvara and Guru is woven\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      21                August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\ntogether on the silken thread of parabhakti. Hence\nShvetashvatara states: \"If you want to understand\nthe truth you must have as much devotion to the\nGuru as you have to God.\" This statement itself\nsupposes a difference between the Guru and God\nand then by some process they are placed on the\nsame pedestal.\n   We will have to clearly understand what is Ishvara\nand who is Guru. In truth, they are not entities.\nWhat is Atman is the Guru and what is Guru is\nIshvara. These are two view points of the same infinite\nReality.\n   The Yoga school devotes itself entirely to the\nconcept the Guru. So much so, it admits that by\nIshwara - Pranidhanna or by entirely surrendering\nto Ishwara also you can achieve Samadhi. The test\nexplains Ishwara only as Guru.\n   The agamas conceive of God both as Ishvara and\nas the Guru. They say, when the \"Sat\", the\nfundamental reality is surcharged with Lord's will, it\nbecomes the Supreme Will and the cosmic             actions\nof creation, etc., follow. On the one side you have\nthe whole world, solid as a book with condensed\nknowledge. On the other, you have the teacher the\nGuru, a living flow of knowledge. You have the book\nand you have the teacher. What else do you need?\nInteresting Questions\n   When we begin Guru upasana, a very interesting\nquestion comes up: Does the shishya discover the\nGuru or the Guru discovers the shishya? In the\nprocess of realization who makes the main effort?\nThe Veda, in one place, mentions specifically that\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       22                August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe Guru's role is a passive one. The  Acharya\nprovided the still base over which the disciple works.\nThere are other sayings where the shishya,\nexpressing his own deep feelings on realization, says:\n\"You are our Father. You brought us up. You have\ntaken us beyond the darkness of ignorance.\" It\nappears that the Guru did everything while the\nshishya was static. Then again a third viewpoint\ncomes which makes a reconciliation between the\nabove two\n   Depending upon the state or the capacity of the\nshishya the Guru will change. We find a single\nGuru dealing with different shishyas in different\nways. We may also find the same shishya reacting\nin different ways to different Gurus.\nGuru Upasana\n   Guru Upasana is an intense and varied interaction\nbetween the level of the Guru and needs of the\nshishya. The nature of the upasana depends upon\nthe psychological set up in which a rapport has to\nbe established.\n   For the sake of convenience, the Shastras describe\nthree kinds of Gurus: Preraka,             Bodhaka and\nMokshada. Preraka is one who inspires; Bodhaka is\none who helps you to understand the path and the\nimplications of walking on it. He is like a friend, not\njust an acquaintance or an adviser. The Third category,\nMokshada, comes like a cyclone and lifts up bodily\nand dumps you in your destination, whether you will\nit or not. Rather, he makes you will it.\n   These are the two main qualities required of the\nshishya: tremendous faith and a burning eagerness\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       23                August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nto be taught. Then alone the greater forms of the\nGuru can manifest. A student should be dedicated\nto the teacher. This dedication alone can make you\nunderstand the teaching, and taste which the Guru\nmakes flow with you. That is what we call a rapport.\nEstablish yourself in the most intimate spiritual\nrapport with the Guru, who is nothing but Ishwara.\n    Through the grace of the Guru, you attain\nproficiency in your path, but the fulfilment of the\npath or the achievement the goal happens only\nthrough the sheer grace of Shiva and the Guru is\nShiva.\n                                                      (Continued)\n            (Courtesy : Samvit Sadhanayana Mt.

Love\nis beyond the implications of name and form - still\nit works through them. Love is beyond the sense of\nduality - still it reveals in multifarious ways. It is the\nomnipotent power that guides and controls all things.\n    Love is unaffected by the touch of time and place.\nThe so-called right and wrong are unknown in the\nrealm of Love. It is not coloured by the conflict of\nopposites and the modes of nature. Its light is of a\ncrystal. Love is spontaneous in expression and\ntherefore supremely blissful. Its manifestation is\nbased upon its indivisible unity and oneness with\nall that exists. Love is the one truth and one power.\nLove is ever taintless, ever flowing and ever acting\nfrom a transcendent plane. All opposites neutralise\nin the undifferentiated spirit of Love. Dove is the\nmystic solvent of all diversity.\n    To realise God who is Love, you are asked to love\none another; to look upon others in the same light\nas yourself; to feel for others as you do for yourself.\nCan you understand the secret of this Love if you\nonly strive to attain it through physical or mental\nperfection without seeking for a greater ideal?

You must attain\nto that consciousness in which you experience the\necstasy of oneness with all beings and creatures in\nthe world. You must feel at the core of your heart\nthat you, another and all are forms of one underlying\nSpirit. Diversity is merely on the surface. In the\nsplendour of Truth, you and all are one.\n   In the vision of oneness and sameness of the life-\nprinciple there can be no dualism and the\nconsequent clash of opposites. This vision is of Love\n- a pure emanation of an almighty and impersonal\nSpirit.

At the\nsight of suffering your heart is touched and it melts.\nIn a mysterious way you now feel the suffering of\nanother as your own. This feeling is not of the body\nor mere mind.

Amma continued to waddle\naway without as much as a backward glance! This was\nhappening for real. She would have to cope without Amma\nand Pappa for days!\nLuna huddled with the other chicks, her heart pounding\nwith fear. Unable to hold back her tears anymore, she\nbegan  to  weep  inconsolably.

When you surrender\nto Her, you will find all your fears melting away, for she will\nfill your heart with strength and courage.\"\nLuna  closed  her  eyes  and  imagined  herself  in  a  warm\nhuddle  with  Pappa  and  Amma.  She  took  a  few  deep\nbreaths till she had calmed down. With every deep breath,\nshe seemed to draw in strength. \"I am safe. I am fine,\" she\ndeclared to herself with her newfound courage.

Wild Emperor penguins are only found in Antarctica\n        -  the  Earth's  southernmost  continent  -  where\n        temperatures  can  drop  to  as  low  as              with-60degC,\n        winds of up to 200km/hr. They breed and raise their\n        young mostly on 'fast ice', a floating platform of\n        frozen ocean which is connected to the land or to ice\n        shelves. From birth, they spend their entire lives in\n        and around the Antarctic ice.\n     2. Emperor penguins are truly beautiful birds. Adults\n        have a white stomach and a black head, back, tail\n        and wings. They also      have yellowy-gold markings on\n        the side of their head and neck.\n     3. Emperor penguins are the largest of the 18 species\n        of penguin found today, and one of the largest of\n        all birds.\n     4. To survive in extremely low temperatures, these\n        brilliant birds have special adaptations - they have\n        large stores of insulating body fat and several\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam             38                    August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nlayers of scale-like feathers that protect them\n        from icy winds. They also huddle close together in\n        large groups to keep themselves, and each other,\n        warm.\n\n     5. Around April every year (the start of the Antarctic\n        winter) emperor penguins meet to breed on the\n        thick Antarctic ice. By the time the female lays her\n        egg (usually around May or June), she has worked\n        up a big appetite! She passes the egg to the male\n        before journeying up to 80 km to the open ocean\n        where she can feed her hungry tummy on fish                ,\n        squidand krill.\n     6. During this time, the males are in charge of\n        keeping the egg safe and warm in the breeding\n        ground. They do this by balancing the egg on their\n        feet and covering it with feathered skin, called a\n        'brood pouch' for between 65 - 75 days to keep it\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam                                          August  202339\n------- PAGE END -------\nwarm and off the snow surface, before it hatches.\n     7. The females return in July, bringing with them\n         food in their bellies which they regurgitate (or\n         throw up) for the chicks to eat. The females now\n         take over babysitting duty, leaving the males to\n         head to the ocean for their own fishing session.\n     8. As the youngsters grow, the parents leave them in\n         groups, called '             ', while they head to thecreches\n         ocean to fish. Come December, the warmer\n         temperatures break up the ice that the penguins\n         occupy, bringing open waters closer to the nesting\n         site. By this time, the chicks are old enough to\n         swim and fish, and take to the ocean themselves!\n\nColouring time: Colour the Penguin\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam                                          August  202340\n------- PAGE END -------\nPonder Awhile: One Stormy Night...\n\nThe sun bid adieu and twilight set\nA starry sky above a lush silhouette\n\nNightfall commenced and darkness descended,\nActivities of the jungle creatures, for the night were\nsuspended\n\nThe choir of cicadas were silenced by a flash of light\nAn electrifying bolt and thunder roared into the night\n\nFor an incoming storm, it was a warning call\nIt wasn't long before big drops started to fall\n\nThus ensued a scamper for a safe space\nTo shield themselves against the storm and cuddle in the\nwarmth of each other's embrace\n\nA crowd gathered inside the hollow of an ancient tree\nTo seek respite from the storm that tore the night with\nmischievous glee\n\nAmidst the congregation there\nwas a little firefly\nEven in this dire situation he had\nunshakable faith and head held\nhigh\n\nWith a soft glow emitting from his frame\nAnxious panic, his light and presence began to tame\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam                                          August  202341\n------- PAGE END -------\nAmidst the fearful gloom he began to radiate\nThrough Anusmaran words of affirmation he did propagate\nHe spoke fondly about warmth and spring\nWhen flowers would bloom and birds would sing\n\nHe narrated incidents of merry celebrations\nHe rekindled memories that overthrew trepidations\n\nThe Guru's wise words and direction he did recall\nWith unshakable nishtha he stood tall\nDespite the roaring gale and the unceasing rainfall\n\nThe squall blew over and the eastern skies hinted of a\nvermilion hue\nDespite the wild night their faith only grew\nOut of the hollow emerged a crowd with zest\n\nLong Ago:      Atma Linga\nThe king of Lanka, Ravana, was a devotee of Lord Shiva. After\nprayers and penance Lord Shiva granted him an Atma Linga,\nwhich would ensure immortality for Ravana. However, Lord\nShiva had warned Ravana that the Linga would become\nsthapita wherever he placed it. Since Ravana had to place the\nAtma Linga on the ground during the course of his journey, he\nwas unable to lift it thereafter. In a rage, he decided to\ndestroy the Linga and flung parts of it far and wide. The cloth\ncovering the Linga dropped at Mrideshwara (as it was\noriginally known), where the current temple stands. The\ndetailed description of this event is given in the Shiva Purana.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam               42                     August 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nOur Heritage: Murdeshwar\n                                        Murdeshwar is a town in\n                                        Bhatkal, Uttara Kannada\n                                        region of Karnataka.

And,\nlooking  to  all  this,  the  question  naturally  arises\nwhether there is really a need for the institutions\n(Maths) which are to follow the rules of such Dharma.\nThe  present  is  the  time  when  people  think  of\neliminating distinctions of caste, and though it looks\nto  be  most  helpful  to  the  institutions  of  the\nVeerashaiva and Bouddha and other creeds which\ndo not recognize caste distinctions, it does not seem\nto be favourable to the religious institutions which\nobserve the distinctions of Varnas such as Brahmins,\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

But, as\nwe shall presently narratc, people voluntarily came\nforward to raise the Math in material well-being\nthough we stood indifferent to its declining monetary\nstate of affairs, and the accomplishment of this\nfunction through our hands, though we had not\ngiven a serious thought to the subject or come to\nany decision about it - all this as if in conformity\nwith Shri Krishna's saying to Arjuna, \"What you do\nnot wish to do through delusion, even that you will\ndo as if forced by others\", makes us feel that the\nholy intention of our ancestors who established the\nMath and the divine hand that helped them in their\nundertaking were really at the back of these events.\n   Our Guru used to look to the management of the\nMath himself during his regime, and the disciples\nhad no hand in the affairs. After his emancipation\n(Samadhi), the laity made strenuous efforts to have\na hand in the management on the ground that it\nwas not a very satisfactory state of things to leave\nthe whole management only to the Math people.\nThey also urged that the rule of excommunication\nimposed by the Math in the matter of foreign travel\nand Ekikaran Parishad should be withdrawn. But\nthose in the Math did not accede to these popular\ndemands on the ground that it would not be proper\nfor them, during the time of our minority, to make\nany change in the system handed down from our\nprevious Gurus. We too were then not in a position\nto shoulder the responsibility of changing the previous\narrangements. This created in the people a feeling\nof indifference towards the Math and led to the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       14              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\ngradual diminution in Vantiga collection. This, in\nturn, gave rise to progressive increase in the burden\nof debts, as it was not possible to check the annual\nexpenditure and make both ends meet.         Our position\nthen was of one who stood on the river bank and\nhelplessly looked to the tearing away of even deep-\nrooted trees in the heavy floods. As we had\npreviously not paid heed to the people's suggestions,\nwe could not, on our own initiative, now raise before\nthem the question of improving the monetary status\nof the Math. It was under such circumstances that,\nas if ordained by Providence, two leading pleaders of\nKarwar, viz. Manjunath Rao Chandavarkar and late\nRaghvendra Rao Gangolli, came to see us at our\nGokarn camp in the month of March 1932, and\nraised the above question. According to their\nsuggestion, a conference of the leaders of our\ncommunity was held in Gokarn in the month of\nMay. As recommended by this conference, a\nconsultative committee was appointed in October,\nThey formed two sub-committees- one to consider\nthe reforms in religious matters (viz: regarding the\nrestraints imposed in connection with foreign travel,\nEkikarana, etc.) and second, to prepare a Constitution\nfor management of the Math. After discussing the\nnecessary matters, the committee also commended\nthe calling of a Mahasabha, both to consider about\nthe religious reforms and to sanction the draft\nConstitution. A Mahasabha was accordingly called\nin December 1932. Under the constitution sanctioned\ntherein, the people themselves have now been\nconducting the Math management on our behalf.\nFormerly the work of Vantiga collection was mostly\ndone during the periodical tours of the Gurus. But,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       15             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nunder the system of Local Sabhas adopted by this\nMahasabha, the members of these Local Sabhas\nhave been looking to the work of Vantiga collection\nevery month. In this way, the people themselves\ncame forward and improved the monetary conditions\nof the Math, and brought the institution to its present\nsatisfactory condition.\n   Similarly, as regards Shishya Sweekar, though\nwe were not personally inclined towards it, we are\nsomehow finding ourselves engaged in it. The\ngentleman who first raised this subject before us\nwas the late Manjeshwar Anant Rao of Puttur. A\nyear or two before the Silver Jubilee Celebration of\nour Sannyas, while he was the Chairman of the\nSupervising Board, he brought forward this\nsuggestion and said that our own adoption of Sanyas,\nhad taken place only at the fag-end of the physical\nlife of our Guru, and, we could not get the benefit\nof His company or experience; and so, we must see\nto it that this state of things should not happen\nagain, and for this purpose, we must hence forward\nbear the subject of Shishya Sweekar in mind. But,\nwe did not give undue weight to the responsibility\ninvolved therein, under the impression that it was a\nmatter which would arise at some distant future.\nAnd, in that light, we replied to him that we would\nkeep that subject in our mind. Thereafter, the late\nKarkal Sadashiv Bhat who was a member of the\nStanding Committee, sometime previous to the Silver\nJubilee Celebration, told us that by reason of the\nimpending Silver Jubilee Celebration, people had a\nnotion of time elapsed in our regime and they were\nexpecting us to make some announcement about\nthe Shishya Sweekar on the occasion of that\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       16             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nCelebration, and that such an announcement would\nmake the people content on the point, We accordingly\nmade the following announcement during the Silver\nJubilee Celebration. \"We understand that people\nwere ardent on the point of Shishya Sweekar and it\nis natural to feel that way. But, this is not a thing\nto be accomplished in a short time. Moreover, we do\nnot feel inclined to hasten the event, in view of the\nfact that Government is eager to interfere in the\nmanagement of religious institutions and to impose\nrestrictions even on the heads of Maths.        Also, we do\nnot at present seem to possess the necessary power\nof penance (Tapobala) to take up a Shishya and\ntrain him in the proper way. If, therefore, you\nleave the matter to our own discretion, we would\ncarry it out later on, at the proper time. However,\nin case you wish it to happen in the early future,\nwe would perform the function at any time if you\nselect and bring a proper lad for the purpose'. After\nthis announcement, Hattiangadi Deva Rao took up\nthe matter; and every time we went to Vittal, he kept\non inquiring as to when we proposed to perform\nShishya Sweekar. We used to tell him in reply:\n\"Astrologers have told us that we are likely to make\nspiritual progress during our Kuja-Dasha period, so,\nthe Shishya Sweekar would have to wait till Kuja-\nDasha is over.\" According to the older system of\nastrology, the Kuja-Dasha was due to expire in 1955.\nAs the Shishya Sweekar Ceremony would have to be\nundertaken thereafter as stated to the people, we\nspent the Chaturmasya of 1954 at Gokarn, as a\npropitious help to the occasion. People came to know\nthat we were thinking about Shishya Sweekar.\nThough we had not decided about the time for the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       17              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nfunction, people somehow came to think that the\nceremony would take place soon after that\nChaturmasya. Their eagerness that Shishya Sweekar\nmust be performed, and that too speedily, might\nprobably be at the root of this wrong impression. In\norder to correct this erroneous impression, in our\nbenedictory speech on the occasion of the Mangala\nof the Maharudra performed at Shirali on Math's\nbehalf in October, we informed the audience that\nthough Shishya Sweekar was certainly going to be\nperformed, it may not be held so early. Though the\nnews of announcement reached the people in\nBombay, they were not aware of its details; so,\naccording to the suggestion of the late Hattiangadi\nShankar Rau, the same announcement was repeated\nduring the Sadhana Week in December. Thereafter,\nin December 1955, a Mahasabha was called at\nMadras to consider the starting of Fund to meet the\nexpenses of Shishya Sweekar Ceremony. There also\nwe expressed that, though the Shishya Sweekar\nwould surely be made, it would take time and could\nnot be held in the nearest future. Thereafter,\nHattiangadi Shankar Rau and Hemmady Shripad\nRao were inquiring about the probable time of the\nShishya Sweekar, in order to enable them to decide\nabout the duration for which the funds collected for\nthat purpose could be deposited, so that they could\nbe made available at the right time for disposal.\nAnd, as often stated to them by us, the function had\nto be performed at this time, that is after the\nChaturmasya of 1958.\n   In the matter of selecting the Shishya or of\nadopting him as such, also, we did not experience\nas much difficulty as we had anticipated. With a\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      18             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nview to set the ball rolling, as far back as in October\n1953, we had asked Baindur Shankar Bhat, the\nMath Astrologer, and Kallianpur Vishweshwar Bhat,\nwho had then come over from Bangalore to Shirali,\nto scrutinize the horoscopes of two lads selected\nfrom two branches of the family of Shukla Bhats of\nShirali, with special reference to the qualities\nnecessary for one who was to occupy this place. The\nboys were so selected from these families, in\ndeference to the promise given by our ancestors to\nthe father of Shrimat Shankarashram-1 that, if a\nsuitable lad could be found in Shukla Bhats' family,\nhe would be given preference in the selection.\nBaindur Shankar Bhat gave his opinion that\nRavindra's horoscope was more suitable for the\npurpose. Thereafter, his horoscope, along with that\nof another lad was shown to other astrologers, and\nit was again found that his (Ravindra's) horoscope\nwas more suitable. After this, we made no further\nattempts about it, under the conviction that there\nwas a lad available if the need arose. Nor did we\ndecide for certain about accepting him only. As he\nwas yet very young, we had also a notion in our\nmind that we could consider the selection of some\nother suitable boy somewhat older in age, if such a\none came in view. But no such boy came under our\nnotice. This function was to be carried out after the\nChaturmasya of 1958 as told to Hemmady Shripad\nRao. Therefore, when we were camping in Bombay\nin June last, we opened this topic before Ravindra's\nparents and they acceded to our suggestion saying\nthat they would never go against our wishes in this\nmatter.\n   In view of all this, we think that there is behind\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nthis ceremony the force of the holy intention of\nour ancestors and also the hand of the Deity in\nwhom they took shelter.\n   There is a general rule of restraint that Sannyasa,\nAgnihotrta, etc. should not be undertaken 5,000\nyears after the commencement of the Kali Yuga; and\nthis 5,000 years' period has already elapsed. But,\nthere is an exception to this rule allowing Sannyas\netc, in the Kali Yuga, so long as there are the\ndistinctions of Brahmin and other Varnas; and the\nVedas are in vogue through study etc.           As regards\nour own community, it may be said that the proper\nduration for the existence of the Math would last\nso long as people do feel the need of this Samsthan.\nAt present, the majority of our people are of opinion\nthat the Math should be kept going, and for that\npurpose there must also be Shishya Sweekar, and\nthey are strongly insistent on the point. Therefore,\nwhatever may be our individual view in the matter,\nthis function has been carried out in deference to\nthe people's wishes.   If they do preserve the Dharma,\nthe continuity of the Samsthan would be justified;\notherwise, it would turn out to be a mere farce.\nRegarding this point, we remember the following\nremark made by      Shri Phadke Shastri        (who is now\npresent amongst us) in course of his speech during\na previous Sadhana Week.\n   'I am indeed happy to find in the people deep\nlove for God and Guru. But my suggestion to\nthem is that they should not rest content with\nthat much only, but in addition, they should keep\nup the practice of Sandhyavandana, etc. and to a\nsmall extent the study of the Vedas, in order to\njustify their being called Brahmins.'\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nIt is true that it is not possible in these times to\npractice Dharma in all its implications; but it is\nnecessary to preserve it at least in its main part to\nthe extent possible. Sandhyavandana should be\nperformed every day, both morning and evening;\nand if time is lacking, at least the japa of the basic\nGayatri Mantra should be unfailingly made. This\nMantra is the means by which to meditate on God,\nand such meditation is essence of Dharma. Similarly,\nthe performance of pancha-maha-yajnas (five kinds\nof daily sacrifices) is prescribed for a Grihastha.\nManu says that by means of their practice, his body\nand senses become fit for the Sadhana required for\nthe attainment of the Brahmic state. Of course, it is\nnot possible for the majority of people in these days\nto perform all the rituals, in all their details. But\none might perform at least some of them in the best\npossible manner. For example,\n    Swadhyaya (Vedadhyayana) is prescribed as being\na fit sacrifice to the Rishis. If this is not possible,\none might keep up the practice of reading Sanskrit\nor Prakrit books containing the principles of Dharma\nand Adhyatma (i.e. Religion and Philosophy) dealt\nwith in the Vedas, every day or when time permits.\nSimilarly, the daily Tarpan is prescribed as a proper\nsacrifice to the ancestors; and, if that is found to be\nimpossible, one should unfailingly perform the\nanniversaries (annual shraddhas) of the elders with\ndue love and faith. Hospitality is a fit sacrifice if one\nhas the feeling (while offering the hospitality) that\nGod Himself has come to accept our service in the\nform of the guests, and one is worshipping the all-\npervasive God through them. If this much at least is\nkept in regular practice, one will derive the benefit\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         21              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nyielded by the five sacrifices (pancha-maha-yajnas).\nThe samskaras (as connoted by that term) will remove\nsuch defects in the body and senses as may hinder\nthe spiritual path. They are not all in vogue now;\nbut, one must preserve at least the main\nSamskaraswhich are in current practice. By their\nperformance, the householders will not only achieve\ntheir own good, but will also be helping the Purohits\nand Vaidiks in maintaining themselves. If the\nCommunity feels the need of the Math, it will also\nrequire the priestly class which helps performance\nof Dharmic rituals prescribed by this institution.\nThe existence of mere Samsthan without the priestly\nclass is of no use. If the Vaidiks were to take other\npursuits in life, they too might earn a prosperous\nlivelihood like the laity. But, instead of that, in order\nto afford religious services to the community, they\nhave to adopt a simple living. Even such a simple\nliving has now become difficult for them. It is,\ntherefore, necessary that Grihasthas should freely\nand liberally remunerate the priests on occasion\nlike Upanayana, Vivaha, etc. and thereby help them\nin their livelihood, instead of spending too much on\nnon-essential items such as dance, music, etc.\n    We pray to the Compassionate Paramatman that\nyou all may get the benefits from the Math for all\ntime and that, by means of the practice of Dharma,\nyou may become fit to attain both material prosperity\nand spiritual well being.\n                          (First published in April 1959)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        22              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Likewise, the Upanishads preach the\npaths of Bhakti, Karma, Jnana and so on which have\nbeen kept before us by our ancients so that man who\nis lost in Sansar will stop crying and attain Knowledge.\nSo, the Vedas and Upanishads have been revealed to\nus mainly to grant contentment to man. Like the child\nwho is crying for some minor cause, so also man is\nconstantly crying for one thing or the other, because\nhe cannot be happy all the time. By means of the\nVedas and Upanishads our ancient sages wanted to\nsave man from himself and make him attain eternal\nhappiness. Upanishads are the essence of Vedas, they\ntell you what your duties are in this world and how\nyou can discharge the same and at the same time\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                    December  202323\n------- PAGE END -------\nkeep yourself free from the coils of Sansar. These\ncannot be dismissed lightly as works of fiction or\nimagination. Our ancients received the Vedas under\ndivine inspiration and they contained what they had\nactually experienced, the joy of God-realizaion.\n    Man may not cry aloud like a child, but he cries\nwithin his heart and mind, because he sees only misery\nlooming large before him. Ninety-nine per cent of the\npeople are like that, who have one sorrow or the other\nand are in constant distress. They should stop this\ncrying, they should attain everlasting peace and\ncontentment. Hence, the simile cited by\nShankaracharya, of a Divine Mother anxious to stop\nHer child's cries, offering him the Upanishads, the\nShastras which would enable the people to forget once\nand for all worldly miseries. It is not necessary to\nspecify what is sorrow and what is happiness. Both\nare matters of experience. Shankaracharya mentions\nthe names of different fruits like grapes, plantains,\nmangoes, dates etc., to denote so many kinds of\nsweetness. Only, the mother knows which sweet is\nwhat and which sweet would make the child stop\ncrying. All that the mother does is to place the various\nfruits before the child which is as good as placing\ndifferent kinds of sweetness before the child. So, also\nthe Upanishads and the Vedas offer man happiness\nof different kinds on tasting which, man will cease to\nhanker for lesser kinds of pleasures. These are words\nof the Vedas and are the Eternal Truth. We must repose\nfull faith and trust in these words and they will help\nus overcome our worldy miseries and grant us\nhappiness.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        24              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nBut as long as man's senses are directed on\nexternal objects, he does not attain eternal happiness,\nthe real happiness that is greater than all other joys\nof life. Forgetting his true Self, man pursues external\nobjects, believing that he has no source of happiness\nin himself and must look outside for it. The Upanishads\ncite the example of a dog who imagines that the dry\nbone contains blood and goes on chewing it with his\nteeth till he cuts through it and cuts his own tongue\nand tastes his own blood and thinks that it is from\nthe bone, and derives hollow satisfaction from this\nfeeling. Similarly, man craves for external objects of\npleasures, fondly imagining that the transitory joy that\nhe gets is real happiness. The Upanishads tell us\nrepeatedly to think for ourselves, to reason out and\nrealise the hollowness of the worldly objects of\npleasure, to realise once and for all that the source of\nreal happiness lies in our own Self. Attaining that\nhappiness is itself attaining Brahman. Once man has\nreached that height of happiness, there is no return\nfor him to the old ways of life. In fact, he becomes a\nsymbol of that happiness. This is what our ancient\nrishis, having attained that happiness in themselves,\nhave written for our benefit.\n    For most people, it is not easy to attain that\nexperience because they are immersed in Sansar, they\nhave worldly diversions and distractions, mundane\nfears and obsessions. All these may be mere shadows\nbut they appear very real, just as the nightmare one\ngets in sleep appears, for the moment, very real and\nfearsome.\n    We have spoken on the theme of happiness\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         25              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nwherever We have gone.      We truly feel that whatever\nWe have spoken at every Sabha visited by Us has\nbeen inspired in Us by Our Guru Mavuli and what\nHe has taught Us.\n   No man is free from the law of Karma, but he ceases\nto feel enmeshed in it if he understands it for what it\nis, namely, the fruits of past actions. To liberate\nhimself, he can tread the path of Jnana Yoga, Bhakti\nYoga or Karma Yoga, the three paths of spiritual\npractice. Jnana Yoga is nor meant for all. It requires\ntremendous amount of concentration and will-power\nas well as severe austerities as one dwells on the\nNameless Formless aspect of the Divine firmly\nbelieving in the concept \"I am Brahman\" or Aham\nBrahma'smi. Usually, man needs an image of God or\nGod's Name to help him develop powers of\nconcentration but in the case of Jnana Yoga, he has\nto concentrate on the Nirguna Swamp which is very\ndifficult for most people.\n   Lord Krishna in His Gita asks us to fix our mind\non Him and dedicate all our actions to Him. That is\nKarma Yoga and it helps one to attain the Lord,\nParamatman. But, this consciousness should be\nconstant and uninterrupted. Man, by nature, is\nsubject to all transitory ups and downs of life. He\nshould develop in himself self-confidence and an inner\nstrength which can withstand these knocks and make\nhim face up to whatever befalls to his lot with\nequanimity, realising that he is not alone in such\nsuffering and that it is part of the human birth given\nto him.\n   Having been born a Brahmin, having inherited the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       26              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nheritage of Brahminhood by the mere birth, what is\nthe kind of karma one should perform? He should\nnot remain content by the mere fact of his being born\na Brahmin.Real Brahmin-hood means leading a life\nof goodness and walking on the path to self-\nenlightenment. A Brahmin should practise\nCompassion, Tolerance, Austerity and Devotion,\nwhich take him nearer to God. Only such a one has\na right to style himself a Brahmin.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                    December  202327\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Let us reflect on Bhuvaneshwari. I speak of\nthis often - First Her feet. We take refuge there. Ah!\nI have found shelter! We receive fearlessness - First\n\"I have something. I belong. I can do. I am protected.\"\nThat conviction becomes firm. Then She starts giving\nboons - \"Oh! There is so much good in me,\" - the\nexperience of that is perceived. Why? Everything is\ncoming because of that connection which is being\nstrengthened. There is a force of expression. Also it\nis internal. It is not a demand from the external.\nYou are not dancing to anybody else's tunes. The\nself - assurance has arisen from an inner joy and\nthat is what is being expressed. Your expression\nmight be on the stage, mic, etc., or in your life also.\nIncidents, situations where you feel that not having\nexperienced Bhuvaneshwari's Grace, \"I didn't deal\nintelligently with this situation.\" But now, with\ngreater inner strength, the same situation is\ntransformed because I am letting it, the strength,\ntransform me correctly. I am not getting  cowed\ndown, but (am acting) out of strength. This guidance\ncomes from upadesha - the teaching and the\ncapacity to take that upadesha to fruition comes\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       30              December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nfrom upasana - spiritual endeavour. So, when doing\nHer Anushthana, we pray for not just strength, but\nalso the opportunity to think more intelligently.

You may have many\nexperiences, but it's a shame if you were to lose\nyourself in them. And so, give only as much value\nto those experiences as is required - It is an\nindication, She is something much beyond what\nnormally confronts me - this world of names and\nforms; but I am not so charmed with that\nexperience, because the 'I' (the experiencer) is the\nego. Finally I'm going to let go of that. All this\nreflection takes place in the mind even as you do\nthings with devotion and because you have been\nlistening (to the Guru's words), it is possible, while\nyou are on the spiritual path, to effortlessly become\none with the Divine. There may be many\nexperiences, you may feel much intensity; but your\ninsistence - \"I will enjoy this as a person\" - goes\naway. Let me go to the source from which all this\nis coming! The desire to come back and say, \"Okay.\nI enjoyed this. Share it,\" probably brings you back\nto the mundane, doesn't it? Makes sense?

And  we\ndemand - \"Now you are aware of me, you have\ncreated me; take care of me.\" We invoke that Divine\nGrace. Consciousness and the profound Silence,\nMahamauna. Not just an ordinary Silence, in that\nMahamauna, as your mind stabilizes becomes calm\nand poised, She's sensed. She was discovered in\nMahamauna. She reveals Herself in Mahamauna. So\nalso Nadaspanda. Now don't get stuck in that - A\nlittle pressure and I will silence my mind. And a dull\nstupid inert silence is not desirable. So She is also\nNadaspanda. Manifestation begins with Nadaspanda.\nFirst sign of creation happening. Nada. Now you are\nvery familiar with this word, Ni Nada. Ni Nada, we\npractice Ni Nada. Nada is an indistinct sound. There\nis no particular musical note in that. Like the roar\nof the ocean, or the clouds, you can't say, \"This is\nyes, this is the Shadaja, that is the ..... there are\ntoo many notes.

There are names like\nBhuvaneshwari. Immediately a visual can be ... you\ncan visualize this. The minute we say 'Durga' - then\nthis is Her form.

Om is the most important. That\nis what is said in the Upanishads and the Vedanta.\nBut there are other manifestations of Pranava - Om.\nThere are Pranavas of the Goddess. In that, Hrim\nis one of the most important. Hrim is the seed-\nmantra of Bhuvaneshwari. That is the most\nfundamental mantra of Bhuvaneshwari.\n                                           - Shirali 2020\n                   Bhuvaneshwari -\n     Her Expansion from Silence to Sound\nChakranilaya Varnajanani\n   Nilaya?

In your\nheart, on the crown of your head, in every chakra,\noutside in an idol. A photo helps you connect to\nHer and to think of Her, but it does not help you\nperform a specific spiritual practice. That practice\ncan definitely be done upon a yantra. There is a\nprocedure involving a yantra - there is the mantra,\nA tantra means that which helps in the expansion\nof our consciousness. When consciousness is\nperceived as limited, the limiting barriers need to\nbe removed. So, here - in Bhuvaneshwari as\nVishwachakreshi, Her worship takes place in the\nchakra. She is the main Shakti established in the\nchakra. Also present are Her deity companions who\nsurround Her. Shri Yantra is more elaborate, and\nso your worship there has to be done carefully.\nBhuvaneshwari's is slightly simpler because She has\nmanifested as the One who is immediately\naccessible. So, Bhuvaneshwari is the Empress of the\nChakra. The word chakra also implies that She is\nthe One who conjures up an illusion - She is the\nOne who has put me into this state of experiencing\nmyself as a separate individual entity. \"There's some\nmischief afoot.\" It's almost like that! And that too,\nfor Her own pleasure! But when that individual\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       35             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nbegins to reflect and investigate, he begins to\nrealize, \"Somewhere I'm being kept in this separate\nindividual state. I'm being kept away.\" That is the\nexperience of Her nigraha Shakti - Her restraining,\nimprisoning power. She creates, sustains and\ndestroys and not only that, She confines - She\ndeludes us and leaves us bewildered. She creates\nthe attraction in the material world and we believe\nthat we receive joy from that alone. So, then there\nemerges the dichotomy, \"I should not be affected\nby this, I should not be affected by specific\nincidents. I am Eternal,\" even if you were to accept\nthis as true, the minute an incident occurs, you\nare overwhelmed by it. That is when you again try\nto back out and try to instantly quieten your mind\nand say. \"I want none of this!\" That is what begins\nto happen. You begin to feel the dichotomy. The\nObliterator of this dichotomy is She alone. The\nminute She says, \"You see it the way I see it. You\nsee it with me and you will transcend!\" This is when\nHer maternal love gushes forth and She becomes\nthe Vimochani- the Liberator. By showing Her\ngrace, She extracts us from this chakra saying, \"I'm\nenjoying this! This is my creation! Why are you\nthere? Why have you got into the arena? You come\nhere and see this!\" Something like that. \"Come out\nand see!\" The One saying that also releases you!\n                                         - Mumbai 2019\n                (Transcribed by Shrikala Kodikal)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       36             December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

In just a few months, Ms. Sheela had become more\nthan a teacher to the children - she was their friend,\nphilosopher and guide. Naturally, the grades of the children\nhad started climbing.

Neglecting his Brahmin duties of praying\nand learning, he was greedy and wanted to make money only\nto indulge his vices. He was a lecherous degenerate person,\nwho neglected his family and created misunderstandings\nbetween friends and relatives for his own ends.

She threw him out once his money was wasted and\nspent.\nHis dishonourable ways had led to ill health. He was roaming\naround with nowhere to go. When he was very sick and about\nto die, he sought shelter in a Shiva temple at\nPratishthanapura. He lay on the floor unable to move,\nperforce listening to the recitation of Shiva Purana and\nreligious sermons at the temple, which concluded on the day\nhe died.\nThe agents of Yama came to drag his soul to hell for the sins\nthat Devaraja had committed. However, Shiva's agents came\nto the rescue and took his soul to Kailasha the abode of Shiva.\nYama explained to his puzzled agents that listening to the\nglorious Shiva Purana in his last days had washed away the\nsins of a lifetime and earned the Grace of Lord Shiva.\n                   Source: Shiva Purana, Dr Mahendra Mittal, Manoj Publications, Delhi.\n\nAmmi Shikyaan - Let's learn together!\nWhen we meet our elders and friends in the Math or even\noutside, we join our palms together with a Namaste and\ngreet, \"Jai Shankar!\"  Right?\nYou'll be happy to know that all through our country,\nespecially in our rural areas, people greet each other with a\nNamaste - accompanied by greetings like Ram Ram, Jai Shri\nKrishna, Jai Hanuman, Namo Narayana, or Jai Siya Ram.\nNamaste comes from the Sanskrit words, \"Namah\", and \"te\" -\n\"Namah\" means \"I bow to\",  and \"te\" means \"You\" meaning,\n\"I bow to you\". Other words similar to Namaste are\nNamaskaar, Namaskaaram, and Pranaam.\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               48                  December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nWhat is the significance of this Namaste?\n\n*  The joining of both hands together represents unity and\nintegrity, and that we all are one. - \"The Divine is the same in\nyou and in me\". Placing the hands in the heart region signifies\nthat when we look in our hearts, we find that we are one with\neverybody. We are honouring the Lord in the person we\nmeet.\n\n*  While doing Namaste, there is no physical contact made\nbetween two individuals.  Physical contact may transfer\nnegativities. Plus, germs and diseases too. Namaste became a\nglobal way of greeting during Covid times.\n\n*  Namaste is used as an expression of gratitude for what we\nhave achieved in our life and for all the blessings we have\nreceived. It is used during worship, while praying to God and\neven while asking for help from somebody.\n\nNamaste is truly an amazing mudra - a gesture that has the\ncapability to deliver multiple forms of powerful expressions!\n\nCredits:\nLittle Ravikiran created with love by Nishtha Naimpally,\nPratima Rege, Chandrima Kalbag, Namrata Heranjal and\nJyothi Bharat Divgi\nEditor: Dr. Chaitanya Gulvady\nWe welcome your feedback at littleravikiran@gmail.com\nYour feedback is important to us!\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               49                  December 2023\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Vayu ascribed it to his own\nand in the same way, the different gods began to\npraise their respective strength. Then the\nParabrahman assumed the form of Yaksha, stood\nbefore the gods, and examined their powers one by\none. Agni, who boasted that he could burn down the\nuniverse with his power, found that he could not,\nwith all his might, burn down even a blade of grass.\nSimilarly, not all the attempts of Vayu could so\nmuch as move the blade. The gods, who had thus\nto pocket their pride, then sent Indra before the\nsaid Yaksha, who took the form of Uma, daughter of\nHimavat, and told Indra that victory was due to the\nPower of the Parabrahman alone.\nPeople attain perfection by worshipping, in the\nform of Gayatri, the Power thus described. The\nworship of this Power, which is not distinct from the\nParabrahman, is the main thing in the procedure\nprescribed for the Navaratra. And this worship gives\n(Delivered in Manki, in November 1939, and\npublished in Kanara Saraswat in same month)\nNA V ARATRA\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 20226\nno room for any distinction as between Shaivas and\nVaishnavas, and is thus a convenient means of\ncreating harmony.\nShri Shankaracharya installed Sharada at\nShringeri, and has thereby spread the cult of Shakti\nworship. But it does not appear that there is any\ntrace of animal sacrifice or of the use of liquor or\nflesh in the course of the worship at that place. The\nPrapanchasara of Shri Shankaracharya mentions a\nvariety of modes of worship, but does not prescribe\nthe use of liquor anywhere. The Vaikritikarahasya\nof the Saptashati clearly says : \"Nowhere is prescribed\nthe method of worship with this sacrifice, liquor,\nflesh etc.\" The Smritis reckon the drinking of liquor\nas one of the five great sins. Hence it is desirable\nthat Brahmans should, in accordance with\nDharmashastra, give up the use of liquor in the\ncourse of worship.\nSome people maintain that, if this method is\ngiven up, it results in the displeasure of the Deity.\nBut will the feeling of such displeasure remain when\nthe prohibition programme initiated by present\nGovernment is universally adopted? Those who call\nthemselves the Sanatanists of the Community do\nnot seem of defy the Sarda Act. Again, to give up the\nuse of liquor in accordance with Dharmashastra is\nfar better than to abandon it through fear of the law.\nAnd as Bhartrihari says, to give up, of one's own\naccord, an object which must go some day, would\nbring peace of mind as well.\nAt the same time, it is a matter of consideration\nfrom the spiritual point of view, that all will strive to\nestablish the reputation that there is no one in the\nCommunity who drinks liquor in any shape or form.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 20227\nIt has been made clear before that there is no\nroom whatever in the Bhagavata Dharma  for such\nevil practices. Accordingly, no one need be under\nthe impression that this practice is in keeping with\nthe Bhagavata tradition.\nMay the Paramatman grant that all may secure\nhappiness and liberation by worshipping Shakti with\nleaves, flowers, fruits and the like alone in accordance\nwith the views expressed by Shri Shankaracharya!","type":"Document"}

Every man must\nadopt a particular way of life for his own good and\nfor the good of his family, for his eternal happiness\nand for his peace of mind.\nThe chief object that every man seeks is peace\nof mind and he wants to know how to achieve that\npeace of mind living in this Sansar. As we said\nbefore, every man needs Sadhana and if he\nperseveres with that Sadhana, he will definitely attain\nthat goal in life. From our experience, We may tell\nyou that the Sadhana that We ourselves did like\nJapa, Anushtan, etc., was instituted by our elders\nfor very good reasons. Having been instructed on\nthis path by Our Guru, We experienced all that We\nwere to experience and We also ecperienced Bliss\nEternal Ourselves, may be not fully but substantially.\nOur elders teach us that Brahman alone is real\nand that all world is Unreal (Brahma Satyam Jagat\nMithya).

Sadhana is concentration on the\nGuru's teachings, having faith in the teachings,\ntaking them for Gospel Truth without having any\ndoubt or misgivings about them, Sadhana teaches\nus how to attain Divine Knowledge and yet move\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\nSHRADDHA\nWHY WE NEED A MATH AND\nTHE GURU\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202210\nabout in this world into which we have been born.\nWe know, having been born into this world, man\nhas to face many vicissitudes in life. When such\noccasions come, if man is firmly rooted in his\nSadhana, no matter what adversities and misfortunes\nbeset him, he remains unaffected and, ultimately,\nhe attains Mukti (liberation) by power of that Sadhana\nalone.\nHence, there are Gurus, Maths, etc, so that\nthey could act as path-finders to confer peace of\nmind to the distressed.\nThe hearts of all God-realised souls are soft\nand, when they see before their very eyes people\ncrying, undergoing difficulties without any apparent\nreason, they are moved. When you go to see a tragedy\non the screen, you buy your own ticket and, then\nwhen you see the film, you shed tears. One who is\noutside the theatre sees you paying and crying like\nthis and is amused. So, also, the Guru and the\nelders, by their precept and practice, have established\nDharma and they teach the people that if they\npursue that path shown by them, they will not cry\nor fall prey to Sansar but will progress onward in\nlife. That is why Maths and Gurus have been\nvouchsafed to us to teach people according to the\ntime and clime.\nGURUPADESHAH\nThe Lord is both the cause and effect. He is\nknowledge personified.

Having been convinced through the teachings\nof the master that the entire world of experience is\nheld in a ceaseless change and thus perishes every\nmoment, the aspirant's mind loses all its feverish\ncravings and turns naturally to a constant search for\nand recognition of the deathless Brahman. In the\nsamvit fire of this ultimate realisation is burnt up all\nthe volitional dirt of his past and potent future--and\nhis whole being offers itself completely to the forces\nof the divine.\nSuch, according to my considered knowledge, is\nthe state of the blessed master.\nHaving swallowed the entire universe in the\nexperience developed through manana, now the\naspirant proceeds to digest it through nididhyasana.\nPurifying Fire\nThis idea of the vigorous nature of spiritual\nattainment is graphically expressed in the second\n(Continued...)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202219\nhalf of the verse through another analogy, that of\nthe sacrificial fire. Samvit is the fire to denote which\nthe word pavaka is used, pointing our the purifying\nnature of samvit. Fire purifies whatever it touches-\n-wood or food.\nThe gross food which goes inside the body is\nconverted by the vaishvanaragni (the gastric fire)\ninto the subtle essence of the body; further, it\nbecomes the fuel of consciousness. The material\nfood is transformed into the conscious mind.\nDevvece3eb efn meesc3e cevee  Says the Upanishad, \"My dear,\nthe mind is made up of food.\" Here, what is meant\nis a manifestation and not a creation of mind. Mind\nbecomes activated by the process of tranformation of\nfood, which strengthens the vital force (prana), which\nin its turn activates the mental stuff. Unless the\nmind is alert how can consciousness manifest itself?\nThe analogy of fire in this verse is to be taken in\na subtler sense where the food is Yetleb YeeefJe (r)e og<ke=Aleced --\nthe past and future 'misdeeds,' deeds that are enacted\nwithout understanding the Self. All these deeds\narising out of ajnana are for a samvit sadhaka a sin.\nIn the spiritual viewpoint both punya and papa are\nto be overcome, transformed and transcended.\nShaking off both good acts and bad ones, one attains\nto the stainless divine equipoise.\nAction Is Inevitable\nBhavi means what the sadhaka will do in the\npresent life. So long as the body is there, some\naction or other is inevitable. This is what is called\nDeeieeceer keAce&, Agami Karma. 'Bhutam' stands for mebef(r)ele keAce&,\nSanchita Karma, the actions prior to the acquiring\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202220\nof the present body. Both these have the potentiality\nof yielding their fruits, to receive which the soul will\nhave to be identified with transmigration. In\ndestroying this identification through the intensity\nof awareness of one's own free spiritual nature, the\nsadhaka burns up the potentialities of both these\nkarmas.\nFuel of Karma\nHow then will you worship samvit? By offering\nthe fuel of karma with great devotion, purity and\nreverence--because it is the divine cosmic fire. Such\na process of offering is called homa or yajna.\nThis gives the complete picture of a pure mind.\nWhen this chitta-shuddhi is achieved the aspirant is\nin possession of a highly purified and elevated\naccumulation of impressions. Only such a mind can\nbe offered in the next step of sadhana, into the fire\nof samvit to be consumed completely and once for all.\nTherefore, the pradahata practice if nididhyasana\nis not possible in earlier stages. When all the karma\nand vasanas are burnt, you experience aham without\nkara. That is to say, you do not need an ego\n(ahamkara) to know yourself. You know the Self\nintuitively, continuously, without anything to infer\nit from. This is the conclusion of the samvit-havana.\nNididhyasana is, therefore, an intensification and\nstretching of a momentous I-existence into eternity.\nIt is a still lightning. It sounds impossible, but that\nis what pradahata means--denuding the I-ness of\nall forms, all akara . Does akasha, the space-\nprinciple, have an akara or form? No. But you cannot\nunderstand this subtle nature of the formless without\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202221\nbringing forms into space and seeing that they have\nno capacity to hold space.\nIt is space that holds them effortlessly, without\npenetration, without letting them touch it. In an\nattempt to understand akasha, you look out and\nsee an enclosed space in front of you; you will have\nto go beyond that enclosure and again see that\nspace in a wider enclosure; then go beyond that\nalso, beyond every horizon, beyond the galaxies,\nand you know it is one continuous space.\nI-ness Stretched\nThis continuity is the nirantarata mentioned in\nthe practice of nididhyasana here. Your 'I-ness'\nstretches itself continuously and finds itself\nuntouched, nothing to do with any form of space or\ntime or thingness, no akara.\nRealise Guru as Param Brahma,  which means\nrealise him as your own Supreme Self. But if you\nsee the Guru, then see him as God, the creator, the\nsustainer and the destroyer of the world.\nDifferences Dissolved\nIn the flood of bliss that is released as a result\nof this double vision of nididhy asana , of the\npurnahuti of the samvit-havana, the difference of\nthe inside and outside is completely swept away and\ndissolved. Everything becomes meaningfully\nmeaningless since everything is fulfilled. The nature\nof that bliss and fullness will be expressed mystically\nin the next couple of verses.\n(Continued...)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar,\nMt.

You see, all\nthe cubs were trying to say the same thing at the same time\nin the loudest voice possible - and the outcome was pure\nnoise. Chintu rubbed opened his eyes and beyond the cousins\nwho were in front of him, in the thicket of the forest, he could\nsee the wicked gleaming eyes of the leader of the hyenas.\nChintu at once stood up. He thought of his mother and his\naunties waiting back for them back home. Amma had said,\n\"You are the fastest on the earth- no one can catch you if you\nput in your best. You have the strength of the cheetah within\n- remember that!\"\nChintu recalled Amma's words and hurriedly whispered to the\nothers, \"The hyenas are right behind - let us run this way. We\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202232\ncan run the fastest and here\nwe go!\" So saying Chintu\nturned and sped while the\nother cubs followed Chintu!\nBefore the startled eyes of\nthe hyenas, who were\nplanning to surround and\nstealthily catch the cubs - the cubs had just vanished! The\nleader shouted,  \"These are mere cubs- we can catch them in\nno time!\" The pack moved in the direction of the cubs.\nBut as Amma had rightly said, \"You are the fastest on the\nearth\" - the cubs were way too fast to be caught!\nCheetah is the fastest land animal. They can accelerate\nfrom 0 to 96 kilometres per hour - in about 3 seconds!\nTheir claws work\nrather like studs on\nfootball boots for\nextra grip when\nsprinting, while their\nlong, muscular tail\nacts as a rudder\nwhen chasing prey such as antelope.\nDid you think cheetahs roar like lions and leopards?\nFun Facts: Cheetah Facts\n*\n*\n* The name Cheetah comes from a  Hindi word , 'chita'\nmeaning - spotted one.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam October 202233\nNO!!!! Don't expect a cheetah to roar - they mew like\nyour pet cat! They lack the special two-piece bone in\nthe throat that allows other big cats to do -  so they\ngrowl, hiss and purr.\nUnlike the other big cats,  the females are solitary,\nwhile males live together (unlike a lion pride, which\nhas multiple females). Male cheetahs team up with\ntheir brothers or other males to form - a   -\ngroups that defend a shared territory and team up to\nhunt prey.\n Unlike most cats, the cheetah mainly hunts in the  day\n- with eyesight far keener than a human being, it can\npick out prey from a distance.\nCheetahs are under threat from the illegal wildlife\ntrade. Demand for cheetahs as pets (particularly in the\nArab countries) means cubs are often taken from the\nwild.\nCheetahs could be sprinting towards extinction. They\nwere once widespread in Africa, as well as the Arabian\nPeninsula and India, but research has shown that\ncheetahs are now found in just 9% of their historic\nrange. More than 90% of them have disappeared\nsince 1900, and the global population is estimated at\nless than 8,000.

Master had gone into the\nminutest details of items for the ceremony., His\ngenerous heart did not fail to think of the Math staff\nand their kin. Who would not long to witness the\nrarest phenomenon in the history of the Math?\nWhoever from among the staff that desired to witness\nthe ceremony at Bombay, was given the to-and-fro\ntravelling fare + pocket money, whatever the number\nin the family from the Master's personal funds. It\nwas a gesture for those who could ill-afford to go to\nfar-off Bombay. In ordinary circumstances, they would\nhave well witnessed the ceremony at the Shirali\nMath itself. Not only the staff but also several ardent,\ndeserving devotees got that rare 'prasad' from the\nMaster. But, the 'left-hand wouldn't know what the\nright hand did'! The receiver alone would feel the\nbounty and beauty of it.\n   As the time was fast approaching for the Master\nand the retinue to leave for Bombay. Master called\nme. The list of retinue was finalized. It was necessarily\na sizable number befitting the coming event, larger\nthan during official tours of the Master. The rest of\nthe staff were supposed to go separately.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        8                 August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nConsequently, only a handful of Math staff remained\nin the Math. It particularly so happened, in practice,\nthat one Archak and one Paricharak looked after the\nday-and night pujas in all Samadhis and Ganapati\nshrine, daily, one after another. There were other\nchores also to be attended to, such as Ashtavadhana\nSeva, Durganamaskara Seva, etc. A mention must\nbe made here: the privileged Archak happened to be\nour late Shukla Anant Bhat and the Paricharak,\nDevdhar Ganesh Murdeshwar.\n   As for me, Master was pleased to direct that I\nmight so plan my trip to Bombay as to see that I\ncame back on the very night after the Shishya-\nsweekar ceremony. Master further directed me to\nengage a force of Police from Bhatkal to keep the\nday-and-night vigil in the precincts of the Math,\nduring my brief absence.\n   It just struck me to put a submission before the\nMaster whether, in the circumstances, it would be\nalright if I stayed in the Math. At this, Masters'\nspontaneous reaction coupled with an inner joy and\nsatisfaction was, to quote His own words, as under:\n\"  If you stay here, we will be extremely at ease, as\nif, we ourselves are here: in that case, there need be\nno police shibbandi...\".\n   I prostrated and made a solemn promise to Him\nthat until Master's return to Shirali, I would not stir\nout of the compound of the Math. It was a rare\nreaction of the Master that I witnessed - of such\nconfidence, happiness and satisfaction! I felt thrilled\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        9                 August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nand blessed. The great Shishya-sweekar ceremony\nwas over. Soon, a telegram was received from Bombay\nafter the ceremony that the event had gone off\nsuccessfully. It was addressed to the Manager. But,\nin the evening, there was another telegram, a letter-\nlike telegram, express, in my personal name,\ndescribing the event, with \"Swami Anandashram\" at\nthe end! What a joy and what a treasure! It confirms\na great saint's saying, \"It is because the Lord\nremembered you First that you remember Him\". My\n'Vrata' of remaining in the compound of the Math\nended, with gracious return of our Master with the\nShishya-swami amidst gaiety and great rejoicing.\n   1962: The country was facing a precarious\nsituation during the Chinese aggression. Government\nat all levels was desperately collecting funds from\nthe public. Collection drives in all nooks and corners\nof cities, towns, villages, etc. were in full swing.\nGovernment officials, and even Ministers were touring\nall around; and Shirali village and the Math were no\nexception.\n   At short notice, a public meeting was held in the\ncompound of the Math. The Minister and local leaders\nappealed for funds.

We  are\nparticularly glad to have come here, for, this is a\nsmall Sabha, far from Bombay though in Bombay,\nand people here have to go long distances to go to\ntheir  work  etc.  By  our  coming  here,  people  here\nhave been able to meet us -- in the last two years,\nwhenever we came to Bombay for health reasons\netc., many of you could not meet us even if you\nvisited the Khar Math, coming from long distances.\nSo, when we decided on this official tour, we felt we\nmust visit Mulund.

Everyone\nloves children and love springs in everyone for those\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                          August  202412\n------- PAGE END -------\nthey call their own. They are, indeed, God's blossoms\nin this garden called His creation. Actually, they are\nbuds that have yet to flower, and you have to take\nevery care to see that the buds do not wither away\nbefore their prime. If you take this care, you will\nhave realised what is Vishwaprem (universal love).\nWe were glad to hear of the reference to our love for\nchildren. Those who look on this world as God's\ngarden look on all living here as children and not\nmerely small children themselves. In fact, those\nwhose minds are yet to develop fully are like children\nand we want to see that they do not \"wither\" away\nbefore they have blossomed fully. They are indeed,\nall of them, buds in God's garden. That is why we\nlove children.\n   But, just as we love children, those who brought\nthem into this world, the parents, should also see\nto it that these buds do not wither away. What do\nwe mean by withering away? It means that we should\nallow our children to develop their faculties fully.\nFor this, parental effort is very much necessary.\nMany parents claim that they do take care of the\nchildren but that the children do not listen and go\ntheir own ways, that they are too playful and not\nattentive enough to their studies etc. Parents think\nthat they are grown-ups, full of wisdom, and that\ntheir children are small and ignorant. Usually, in\nthe eyes of parents, children are always small. But,\nchildren are shaped as the parents make them.\nUnless the parents discipline themselves, they cannot\nmould their children's minds and lives. Our\nUpanishads tell us how we should rear our children.\nIf you follow these tenets, we have no doubt, your\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        13                August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nchildren will attain wisdom and knowledge. Not only\nthat, you will take pride in their achievements and\nthen come to take pride in the achievements of\nother children as well.\n   What are the Upanishadic tenets to be taught to\nchildren by the parents observing them themselves?\nFirstly, Satyam Vada: Speak the truth and truth\nalone. Many parents are in the habit of telling lies\nimagining that the children do not know about it\nbut, in reality, children are very perceptive and know\nfull well when they hear parents lie to them. So,\nparents should tell the truth always to impress the\nimportance of telling truth on their children.\nSecondly, Dharmam Chara: At the time of the thread\nceremony, the small boy of eight years or so sits on\nthe father's lap to hear the Upadesh whispered into\nhis ears. Now-a-days, the father first whispers to the\npurohit asking him what is Gayatri-japa and then\nwhispers it back into the ears of his child! Unless\nthe father observes Gayatri recitation himself, he\ncannot impart it to his child. Parents should teach\nin simple and easy-to-understand terms what is\nDharma. It will enable their children to attain the\nwisdom of their elders. Thirdly, Swadhyaya This\nspeaks of the importance of reading sacred books\nwhich help one in God remembrance. You may call\nit homework, because it is intended to make you\nremember God within your own home. Keep on\nperforming your Swadhyaya and train your children\non how to conduct themselves in their day-to-day\nlife. The child has to be taught how to behave before\nhis teacher, his friends and even before animals,\ntaught not to hurt any living creatures, why God\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       14                 August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nshold be worshipped, his conduct towards mother,\nfather and elders and what are his duties to them.\nHe has to be told how to conduct himself before his\nguests and what are his various duties as he grows\nup in life. He has to be taught how to give. When\nyou give, you should give not for the sake of giving,\nbut give with all heart and sincerity, give according\nto the needs of the recipient who is standing before\nyou, realising why he has come to you. When you\ndo not know what to do, consult your elders and\ntake their cooperation and help in all your actions.\nIt is our duty to tell you what we know but it is for\nyou to grasp and understand according to your\nindividual abilities and, accordingly, mould the lives\nof your children. We are known as            Saraswats or\nSaraswatiputras and we must live up to the ideal\nthat this title signifies. Only then can we bring up\nour children so that they can shine as\nSaraswatiputras and we can take pride in their\nachievements.\n   As we mentioned earlier, today is Sankashti\nChaturthi, when many people worship Ganapati, an\nwe want to speak on this theme. Ganapati is\ndescribed by the Scriptures as degone who has added\nto the divine lustre on the face of His mother.\" He\nis also described as Gajanan who gives freely to each\none according to his prayers and wishes. Let us\ntoday remember Him. There is a wealth of meaning\nbehind this scriptural description of Ganapati. He is\ncalled Eka-danta, Vakra-tunda etc. Eka-danta does\nnot mean single tusked. In Puranas and other sacred\nbooks, Ganapati is defined as the Creator, Preserver\nand Protector of the Ganas or the people. In no\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       15                August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nother name of the Lord do we see both His Maya\naspect and Divine aspect conjoined. But, in the name\nof Ganapati, you see both, namely: Gana, that is\nMaya, and Pati, that is Brahma Manifest. We are\nexhorted to adulate the Eka-danta, to keep Him\nalways in our mind, to pray to Him and to attain\ndivine knowledge. Maya is said to entice us and\nentrap us, keeping us pinned to worldly distractions.\n\"Ek\" stands for Maya, the enticer, while \"Danta\"\nmeans the queller of such a Maya, portrays the Lord\nas the subduing force. Thus, Eka-Danta is One who\nsubdues the Maya for our sake and liberates us. The\nLord Himself creates this Maya for the sake of His\ndivine sport (Lila) and then rescues on from its\nsnare as the Saviour.\n   Ganapati is also called \"Vakra tunda\" or One\nwith the twisted trunk. Its real significance is that\nbecause of Maya, we cannot see His true form. In\nfact, we cannot see what is His Maya and what is His\nreal Self. Here, Maya is represented by the word\n\"vakra\" but, for saving His devotees, He keeps the\ntrunk in the centre so that the devotee can see Him\nfor what He is what His true form is. The idols are\nas the devotees imagine their Lord to be. Murti\npujan or idol worship is necessary for one who is\nstarting on his spiritual path and it helps him to\nattain concentration. We pray to Lord\nBhavanishankar to increase your devotion and tender\nthe same at His Feet.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       16                August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

To\nhave  absolute  belief  /  faith  in  the  words  of  the\nGuru  and the  scriptures (shastras).  To have  that\nunflinching faith - is called shraddha.

Keeping absolute faith in our\nshastras and in the words of the Guru, inculcating\nthe samskaras given by them and awakening them\nwhile moving forward - this is our practice.\n               - Shri Vyas Ashram, Haridwar 2023\n  Shraddha and Nishttha - Role in Vimarsha\n   It is a quality -  in a Sadhaka it is called\nNishttha. A steadfast conviction. Shraddha\nincreases. When Nishtha is talked about - that is\nit. That is a prime requirement. But even to\ninculcate nishtha, one needs to think deeply. It will\nnot happen by just sheer obstinacy. It is like this\n- God puts us to the test. Different situations\nconfront us which should not be ignored. For\nNishtha to be established, a lot of contemplation\nneeds to be done. Having performed satsanga,\ntaking one's experience into consideration, such\ncontemplation is called vimarsha. Without vimarsha,\nyou will be like animals - prakrti baddha (bound\nby instinct). Similarly we even conduct vimarsha for\nchildren. Taking one word or one shloka or maybe\neven one sentence. Where does that sentence or\nthat word come from? From the Shastras. So, it is\nthis way. So, first, we must accept that with\ndevotion. Yes, we accept this. But it seems difficult.\nSo how do I make it applicable? That is how the\nprocess of vimarsh is inculcated. That is of\nparamount importance. Even in Shiva - tattva Shiva\nis considered Light, Pure Knowledge. Vimarsh is the\nexperiential or expressed knowledge. So it is there.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      18                August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nThere is something. Now I know- that spark ignites.\nThat is vimarsha. So, your self-effort also comes into\nplay. So as you do the     DeejeOevee(worship) of the Shiva-\ntattva, there the Shakti awakens as well and\nnishtha is estsblished. But it must be assimilated.\nIs it not? It should be applicable. My life should\nbe touched by the spark of the Divine. Because of\nthat Shakti, wellbeing should set in. When there\nis such insistence there is necessity to do vimarsha.\nThere is a need for contemplation. Similarly, this\n\"I don't know. Things will get better in the future.\nThe Gods and the Shastras have expounded\" - is\nnot enough. You are supposed to feel the\ntransformation in this life. \"Now nothing is\nhappening, later ....\" We do not do this. That is how\nit is. We do accept Heaven etc. But that is also\nmomentary.Compared to becoming One (with the\nSupreme) That is Eternal.

Not, the spiritual aspirant, but\nthe disciple. A sadhaka has already got his\npreconceived ideas. So it affects the shishya. ' How\ncan I do this, so that the Guru will be happy with\nme?' Simple. That is how the disciple is. In such\nsituations only nishtha helps. What is our devotion\nlike? Devotion is seen when bhajans are sung and\ndevotees gather. Else most times, there is an insipid\ndryness. So, it is just an emotion. It has not become\nrobust. If you have been connected for years and\nif you have maintained your spiritual practices, then\nI would say that your nishtha is growing in\nintensity. So, if it is not yet nishtha, then it is\ncalled shraddha - faith. Gurushastra vachaneshu\natyanta astikya- buddhih. This is shraddha. A belief\nin the Guru and the sacred scriptures - that is,\n'Yes, this is how it is. Why is it so? That I do not\nknow. My Guru has said so. And He has said that\non the basis of shastras.' The faith that leads you\nto arrive at this state of understanding is shraddha.\nThis is the first stage. We have to deepen our\nshraddha. Situations will arise, and we will make\nthe attempt - ' I have heard of this, but I don't\nknow, I can't seem to apply it in this situation. But\nstill Swamiji has spoken of it, and so, though I have\nnot understood myself, the situation and the\ninstruction, so what will I go by? By the situation?\nI am finished. By my understanding? I am totally\nlost. So, I have to understand from how I have\ninterpreted it. But it doesn't seem that I can apply\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20                 August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nit here, so I need to think about the instruction\nand consider all its aspects.' Deliberation has its\nown power, and that processing is shraddha.\nIntelligently we have to understand, 'How can I\nmake it applicable here?' And definitely as Samvit\nsadhakas also, we are not satisfied with theory, we\nwant to see it happening in our lives. When we\nwork together, these corrections come to us. That's\na great thing. So, shraddha needs to be intensified.\nAt some point, that conviction comes in. It is not\njust faith. It is shraddha at it's highest. It's\nculmination. A continuous steadfast state. Then\nyou'll find a peace coming in that strength. Then\nthe inspirations will come to you, and you will\nreceive the Guru's guidance. That is what is known\nas nishtha.\n                                          - Shirali 2020\nNishtha - the state of unshakeable conviction\n   Stitha asmi. I am now steady and stable.\nSthitah.

Aditi is the\nDeva-Mata married to Kashyapa, Rshi and she stands\nfor all that unites or avoids division. Therefore she\ngives birth to the twelve Adityas, Sungods. Solar\nenergy is a wholesome symbol for the spiritual\ncreative force of Brahman. Apart from the function\nof removing darkness (name fifty one) it illustrates\nthe positive role of the Guru who manifests in the\nreleased soul, the light of Truth that creates and\nreveals the meaningful harmony of things.

The\nDakshnimurti-Upanishad describes it as the Lord\ndisplaying in his four hands the jnana-mudra,\nakshmala, Vina and Pustaka, beginning from the right\nlower hand in the clock-wise sequence. The\nsignificance of the Vina, held in the Lord's upper left\nhand, has been elaborated in name thirty. The\npresent name may be taken as restatement of the\nsame. But on close scrutiny one may also discover a\nvery subtle difference.\n   Here the Lord is depicted as 'playing' on the\ninstrument, not just holding or displaying it. Playing\non the Vina is not possible with one hand. So, here\nwe have a different version of Dalcshinamurti where\nhe abandons his jnanamudra and starts sounding the\nstrings of his beloved instrument and gets absorbed\nin his own music, in the most beautiful expression\nof his soul.\n   In name thirty, we have observed that the mudras\nindicate the shravana-manana-nididhyasana\nsadhanas of knowledge. Playing on the instrument\nand becoming 'intent' on it is the ultimate of\nnididhyasana, and depicts the fully enlightened\njivan-mukta. We may note that as the teacher,\nDakshinamurti manifests shravana. He does manna\nas the shishya, and as the siddha, the enlightened\nsadhaka, he is lost in nididhyasana, which is not\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       26                August 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nclosing eyes in meditation but being in complete\nrapport with the truth within. That is the picture we\nhave here.\n    We may now scrutinize the word 'Tantri' used for\nthe Vina, the stringed-instrument. It stands apart\nfrom the other two kinds of musical instruments- viz.\nthe percussion and reed. These three are fundamental\nmodes of making musical sounds, or for that matter,\ncreating any meaningful sound, like speaking, with\nwhich we are familiar. The vocal cords, the tongue\nand the nose function similar to these three\ninstruments. Taking the word Tantri' as an indication\n(upalakshana) of the other instruments also, or\nmerely of the vocal-cords, we get the present name\nto mean that the Lord is intent on creating speech.\nHe is the inward Chiti Shakti which impels man to\nexpress his knowledge in articulate or orchestrated\nsounds. The Kenopanishad defines Brahman as the\nimpeller of speech. Dhruva's famous prayer also\ndescribes the parama purusha as the luminous power\nthat enters within the human body and awakens the\nslumbering speech and inspires all other organs of\naction and perception. That is why the Gurumurti,\njust like Goddesses Saraswati and Matangi, is said\nto play on it. Nataraja prefers the Damaru beat, and\nKrshna the flute.\n55)  le(c)cetuewJeAefveue3e :\n    Who is ever attached to residing at the foot of the\ntree.\n    The English word 'tree' is another form of the\npopular Sanskrit one 'taru'.

So the tree was recognized\n'Tam' and it symbolizes all the natural means to cross\nover the miseries of life. The tree is aptly the symbol\nof everlasting life. Therefore it is equally reasonable\nto conceive of the Divine Lord of everlasting\nblessedness as seated at the root or beginning of this\nuniversal evolution. According to Vedanta, knowledge\nalone can liberate a soul from the ocean of samsara.\nWisdom is the tree; presided over by the Master.\n    In the Dakshinamurti context, the tree in question\nis the banyan tree. Its Sanskrit name is Nyagrodha\n(v3eueesOe:) meaning nthat which defies all obstructions.\nIt is also called Vata       (Jei:) because it spreads by\ndividing itself and dropping roots from its branches.\nIt stands for the psychic force that plays a central\nrole in Cosmic evolution, finding its acute focus in\nman. It is significant that Dakshinamurti should\nalways be found seated at its root.\n    Hindu tradition is replete with arboreal worship.\nCertain trees are reputed for their particular psychic\nefficacy, the Vatavrksha is one such. Demigods called\nyakshas are supposed to reside in it. The name\nyaksha (implying one with indefinite form) is applied\nin the Upanishads for Brahman or Shiva.

As it is not possible for ordinary people to\nconvince such persons, the Paramatman incarnates\nHimself as stated in the Gita, and establishes Dharma.\nAnd that is how theism is alive to this day.\n   The researches of modern scientists in this\nconnection are still incomplete, but do not disprove\nwhat they have not discovered. And there is the\npossibility of their proving the existence of God in\ncourse of time.\n   Thus though the forces of theism and atheism\nare seemingly equal, theism is reinforced by the\nevidence of great souls who have realised God. The\nconversion of the arch-atheist Vivekananda to theism\nby Ramakrishna Paramahansa, is not an incident\nfrom the Puranas. Similarly, it may be inferred from\nmany a recent event that God does exist.\n   Let us now proceed to consider why we should\nseek the shelter of God.\n   The injunction that one must seek His shelter\ncannot be found in the schools of Sankhya and\nJaimini. Vedanta enjoins the worship of Brahman\nwithout attributes. But the Brahman sought by the\nVedantists is not different from Ishvara. It is in this\nsense that Shri Krishna says in the Gita that He is\nworshipped by the suffering, the seeker of knowledge,\nthe seeker of possessions, and the wise (VII - 16).\nIndeed, this statement makes it clear that the shelter\nof Ishvara has to be sought by the suffering for the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        6                   April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nrelief of suffering, by the seeker of knowledge for\nthe attainment of knowledge, and by the seeker of\npossessions for the acquisition of possessions, and\nthus provides the answer to the question why we\nshould seek such shelter.\n   Shri Krishna has also declared in the Gita that\nHe bears the burden of responsibility for the\nhappiness and protection of those who worship Him\nwith undivided heart (IX - 22). Numerous examples\nof this have come to notice from time to time. At the\npresent moment, there is the case of the Ashram of\nRamana Maharshi where, although it is not usual to\nstore up material in advance, the day to day feeding\nof the great number of devotees that assemble, and\nother matters proceeds automatically without a hitch.\n   It may be that, on occasions, the force of\nprarabdha outweighs the power of worship, thus\nleading to disappointment in material expectations.\nBut the prospect of spiritual peace is always present\nin theism and this satisfaction may lead to the saving\nof human life. There are not a few instances of\natheists taking refuge in suicide when faced with\ntroubles which are too hard for them to bear.\n   Hence may we all seek the shelter of God to gain\nthe primary object of spiritual peace as well as the\nsecondary one of material prosperity, and may they\nthereby be blessed!\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        7                   April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

In the above verse, the venerable Adi\nShankaracharya counsels us to look upon our mind\nitself as a Kalasha and do the Punyahavachana. Our\nbody, he says, is like a Mandira, a temple. Our mind\nis the sacred vessel, Kalasha. Bhakti, devotion, is\nlike the sheet of cloth. Santosha contentment, is the\nwater in the Kalasha. Our daily life is a struggle. We\nhave to contend with so many difficulties, so many\npainful pitfalls. Fearlessly, we should learn to face\nthem, telling ourselves that they are for our own\ngood. Such positive acceptance of all ups and downs\nin life gives us contentment, santosha and\nsamadhana. This is the water we should fill into the\nKalasha of our mind. What are the mango leaves in\nthis metaphor? Adi Shankaracharya says they are\nthe tender Feet of God. We should enshrine these\nFeet in our mind just as we place mango leaves in\nthe Kalasha. If we follow these directions, we are\nrewarded with the fruit of Samvit, Shuddha Jnana,\nEnlightenment, Illumination. This compares to the\nShreephal, the coconut. We should cherish the\nconviction in our mind that God is not separate from\nus at any time under any circumstances. This\nconviction itself is like a mantra. There is no need\nfor any other mantra or tantra.\n   Adi Shankaracharya wants us to perform this\nPunyahavachana, this Brahmakalasha Sthapana, in\nour day-to-day life.

There was nothing on earth that could\nbear the onrush of grace except the             tapasya of\nMahadeva. The     jata is a symbol for     tapas. Similarly\nin our individual life,    titiksha or bearing with the\nvicissitudes of life -- honour and dishonour, heat and\ncold, joy and misery, will only help the        tapas.\n   The real significance of         tapas is to execute\nsvadharma in utter dedication. From the moment of\nhis birth, man is surrounded by rules. The ingredients\nfor his spiritual growth come speeding towards him.\nHe has to accept and react to them in tune with the\nDivine, which gives the soul the field and lays down\nthe laws of working.\n   If you follow the laws of    tapas, then you will have\nGod's strength infused into you. That process has\nbeen described in the latter half of the\nShvetashvatara mantra: \"tattvasya tattvena sametya\nyogam:\" \"One attains to       yoga, the pure awareness\nof the self identified with God, who is projected as\nthe reality of the world\".\n   How is this attained? The           mantra cryptically\nanswers: Through the practice of the single, the\ntwin, the triple or the eight-fold path. Here we have\na graded course of     sadhana. For the most eminent,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       18                  April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe path of \"one\" which is an offering of oneself to\nthe Divine--Isvarapranidhana--is applicable. A very\nhighly evolved soul alone can do this in one stroke.\n   When this ripeness is lacking, the  two-fold path\ncomes to our help. Besides       Isvara comes Guru and\nwe have recourse to     Isvara Seva   and Guru Seva. But\nthis intimacy with the     Guru and the essence of the\nscriptures is also rather difficult. Therefore, it is\nadvisable to take up the three-fold path--shravana,\nmanana, nididhyasana-- needed to substantiate the\nGuru Upasana.\n   Shravana is a process of hearing the saying of\nthe scriptures. Thinking over them constantly is\nmanana. The next step is                  nididhyasana--\ninternalising it. It is a deep state of absorption,\nleading to revelation of the Eternal Reality. To achieve\nnididhyasana, the entire      Ashtanga Yoga (the eight-\nfold) has to be put into use. So, we find in this\nmantra a telescopic arrangement, one set of         sadhana\nsliding into the interior. The eight-fold, culminating\ninto the one - the total giving-up.\nThe Six    Atmagunas\n   Acharya Shankara and other great Masters have\nconsistently upheld as the       atmagunas, a set of six\nqualities --shatsampatti. Shama, dama, uparati,\ntitiksha, shraddha and samadhana-- are the six\natmagunas, the six faces through which we have to\nsee  Atman.\n   They can be considered in three pairs: The first\npair, shama and      dama, means control of the mind\nand the senses.    Uparati and    titikshna pertain to that\npower through which we prevent frittering away of\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        19                  April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nour energies, avoid the wastage incurred or damage\ndone to our psychic energy.              Shraddha        and\nsamadhana pertain to two powers-one of generation,\nthe other of concentration or absorption. All these\nare very essential for the flight of the soul towards\nthe Infinite.\n                  The Vision of the 'I'\n   In the context of the third        mantra of the sixth\nchapter of the   Shvetashvatara Upanishad, dealt with\npreviously we tried in the beginning to have a glimpse\nof the timeless as the seed of the Universe, of that\nwhich was when creation was not. This puts a great\nstrain upon our imagination. But when we come to\nwhat has been indicated in the        mantra that the seed\nof the Universe is verily the seed of the soul, your\nown self, then we try to see the timeless unchanging\nessence in the depth of our own being.\n   We found that this        mantra, in a nutshell, puts\nforth the entire     Samvit Sadhana, beginning with\ndedicated actions and culminationg in               yoga or\nrealisation of  the ultimate that is achieved through\nthe single, the double, the triple and the eight-fold\npath. We have already seen that before we start\nascending this stairway to freedom, we must strike\na mine of spiritual gems--the      shat-sampatti, and take\nthem with us to offer at the feet of the Divine. You\ncannot do it in a day or in a year or perhaps not\neven in a single birth.\nSelf-realisation\n   Nachiketa, going to the very limits of life, to the\nGod of death, asked him, \"What is             Atma?\" Yama\nanswered: \"Know what the Self is\".\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        20                   April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nHere in the Self we come to the unity in all\nbeings--the  fundamental unity where all questions\ncease, where all answers get a meaning and where\nthe strife of life enters into an undisturbed peace.\nTherefore there is one path, there is one method,\nwhich is attained in one moment. It is that moment\nof Self-realisation. One moment, in which the scales\nfall off the eyes and a new vision comes.\n   Self-realisation certainly is no day-dreaming. It is\na powerful perception that transforms the entire life,\nendowing it with a rare richness and stability.\n   We have already seen that          yoga is very much\nneeded to control the mind and the senses, each\nsense needing a particular practice of          yoga, each\nvasana needing a different treatment. Hence             yoga\ncannot be belittled. The     Yoga Vasishtha goes to the\nextent of placing it on the same pedestal as          jnana:\nTo arrive at the non-dual truth you must obliterate\nthe mind, the basis of duality. And this is achieved\nby a two-pronged means,         jnana   and yoga.\nSuperior Viewing\n   A superior form of seeing, when acquired, takes\naway the littleness of everything. Whatever your eyes\nalight upon is seen as the      Brahmna, the unlimited.\n   Let us consider the ego,  the expression of the\n'I'. Through a little      vichara, some reading and\nsatsanga, your ego gets 'purified' enough not to\nconfuse itself with the gross body. But yet you do\nnot quite understand what is really is. This \"I\"\nconsciousness can be flooded with \"light\" only\nthrough the    jnana drishti.\n   When jnana drishti arises, you see your\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       21                   April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nunqualified self like the unqualified space which\nexisted always.\n    Try to feel it by a turning-in of the attention.\nCatch hold of that inward movement of attention\nand practice a similar turning-in, to perceice the\nground of all perceptions. Just as you can, without\nlooking, feel you are sitting, try to feel you are that\nwhich has been untarnished by countless biths since\nthe ageless past. Thus all things become blissful.\n    The moment the \"I\" gets identified with the\nUpadhis, the appendages or instruments meant for\nthe working of that \"I\", then the sense of doership\nand duties arise. The father, the husband and the\nking--all these are forms of identified \"I\", the\nahankara.\n    In the Gita, the Lord says: \"Ahankara may prevent\nyou from accepting the truth of the real 'Aham' I am\nrevealing to you. Deprived of that truth, you will\nperish\".  Vairagya is the force of dispassion which\nwill help you to detach yourself        from  ahankara and\nall the modifications of the mind and senses.\n    When the ego is torn in one stroke, 'tattvena\nsametya  yogam' becomes possible. This stripping of\nourselves, of all  the trapping of the soul can be\ndone with one will, in one stroke. But, if the might\nfor that will is lacking, there are many things that\ngo to strengthen the will. We shall look at them\nnow.\n                                                  (Continued)\n          (Courtesy :    Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt.

Real happiness does not depend on\nexternal objects of fulfillment; it comes from within, when the Self\nreveals itself.\"\n    -- H. H. Shrimat Parijnanashram Swamiji III\n\nStory Time:  Guddu soars up in happiness\nDeep in the Bhadra forest, upon a very tall tree, lived a\nhappy  family  of  eagles:  Amma  eagle,  Pappa  eagle  and\nGuddu, the eaglet. Guddu was the apple of Amma's and\nPappa's eye. Everyday they would play with him and take\nturns bringing him the yummiest food from the forest. They\nwould feed him and feed him till he could eat no more! No\nwonder he grew up so quickly that he was soon ready to fly.\n\nAmma and Pappa started teaching Guddu how to fly around\nthe vicinity of their nest. One day, Guddu begged to explore\nthe world with Pappa. Pappa finally gave in and promised to\ntake him on a tour of the forest the next day. That night,\nwhile Guddu was fast asleep, Amma and Pappa watched\ntheir little one with great pride. \"Oh! How quickly they grow\nup,\"  sighed  Amma  as  she  went  to  bed  with  great\nsatisfaction.\n\nThe next day, Pappa took Guddu to a nearby lake. While\nthey rested on the branch of a tree, Guddu spotted a large\nblue bird with the most colourful feathers. The bird looked\nmajestic as it flew gracefully across the shimmering lake.\nGuddu watched it in utter amazement. \"That is a peacock,\"\nsaid  Pappa.  Guddu  looked  at  the  peacock's  exquisite\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam             30                      April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nfeathers and then at his own dull, brown ones. \"When will I\ngrow feathers like those?\" he asked innocently. \"We are\neagles, son. We soar high up in the sky. Those feathers are\nsurely beautiful, but they are heavy too. They would weigh\nus down,\" explained Pappa. \"But I want them! I want them\nright now!!\" Guddu demanded. \"Sorry, Guddu. I wish I\ncould help you. But no matter how hard we tried, we would\nnever be able to change your feathers,\" said Pappa firmly.\nGuddu sulked for the rest of the trip.\n\nOnce, Guddu spotted a beautiful nest hanging from a tree\ntop. He stared in wide-eyed wonder at the soft, cozy nest.\n\"That's a weaver bird's nest, Guddu,\" said Amma. \"Can we\nhave one like that, Amma?\" asked Guddu. \"Unfortunately,\nwe cannot weave nests like that,\" Amma replied, dashing\nGuddu's  hopes  instantly.  She  tried  to  console  him  by\nmaking their nest cozier, but Guddu was unwilling to settle\nfor anything less than the same hanging nest! On another\nday, Guddu heard the cuckoo bird and tried to sing like him.\nAlas! He failed miserably.\n\nDays passed, and the more Guddu explored the world, the\nmore he became aware of the things he could never have.\nWith   every   passing   day,   he   grew   more   silent   and\nwithdrawn. Amma tried to cheer him up by bringing him his\nfavourite food - fish! But it did not give him the same joy\nanymore. \"Oh! Whatever happened to our happy baby?!\"\nbemoaned  Amma.  \"Don't  you  worry!  I  have  just  the\nsolution\", Pappa reassured her, with a twinkle in his eye.\n\nThe next day, Pappa      said, \"Guddu, you have grown strong\nnow. You are ready to fly high!\" So off they went on a flying\nexpedition. When they hit a strong air current, Pappa said,\n\"Don't flap your wings so hard, Guddu... save your energy.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam             31                       April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nSpread  your  wings  wide  and  ride  the  current.\"  Guddu\nfollowed Pappa's instructions. Next, Pappa started circling\nwithin  the  rising  air  current,  and  Guddu  followed  suit.\nWhen Guddu finally looked down, he could not believe his\neyes - he was high above the clouds!! He screeched in\nexcitement!\n\nNow Guddu was hungry for more. He quickly learnt all the\nmanoeuvers that Pappa could teach him and then some\nmore! He was simply unstoppable! He soared high above\nthe clouds and took a steep dive towards the la                    ke. He\nstopped  just  before  touching  the  water  and  remained\nmotionless mid-air for as long as he could before soaring\nhigh  again.  Oh,  the  joy  of  flying!  Gliding  across  the\nlandscape, Guddu looked down at the forest below. The\ntrees, the lake, the birds and their nests - all seemed so tiny\nand insignificant. How silly of him to brood over things he\ncould  never  have!  They  did  not  even  matter  anymore!\nGuddu  spread  his  wings  wide  and  revelled  in  the  vast\nexpanse of the sky.\n\nFun Facts:     Garuda Snippets\n\n    *  Eagles have highly developed binocular vision, which allows\n         them to focus on distant objects with great accuracy. This is\n         due to the high number of cone cells in their retinas, as\n         well as the presence of a specialized area called the fovea,\n         which is densely packed with these cone cells. This\n         excellent vision aids them in hunting, as they can spot prey\n         from great distances and calculate the precise moment to\n         strike.\n\n    *   Their grip is ten times stronger than ours!\n\n    *  A baby eagle is called an eaglet  Not on.   ly are eaglets the\n         cutest things ever but they're also stubborn birds.Even\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               32                        April 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nthough it takes them a while to get the hang of flying\n          they don't give up.Eaglets find landings the hardest\n          thing to perfect.

As the\nShankara bhashya says in explanation of an aphorism\nin the Smritis, \"If the dust on the mirror is washed\naway, the reflection clearly appears; even so, if the\nsinful propensities of the heart die out through the\nperformance of right action, the likeness of the Atman\nshines forth\".\nIn present conditions, when grihasthas find it hard\nto eke out a living themselves, they may find it harder\nstill to bear the burden of protecting the other three\nashramas which tend towards nivritti. As some adopt\nthe garb of the Sanyasi merely as a means of\nlivelihood, the few rich people that exist have often\nhad to treat the order with indifference. In\nconsequence, the true Sanyasi finds it difficult even\nto live. It is therefore better to remain a householder\nand strive for liberation than to resort to the path of\nknowledge and adopt sanyas.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 20226\nIt may be doubted whether it is possible to perform\nall the actions prescribed for the householder and\nstrive for liberation at the same time. But Yajnyavalkya\nhas, as it were, selected the particular types of action\nwhich householder can make it possible to practise\nin these days, and also said in so many words that\nthey can secure liberation even through such actions.\nAccordingly, let us consider the types mentioned by\nthat saga.\nFirst of all, he warns us that, whatever good deeds\nmay be undertaken, wealth lawfully earned should\nalone be utilized there for. The suggestion apparently\nis that attention should be paid primarily to ethical\nprinciples or restrains. In any case, the contention of\nthe Shastras that adherence to evil ways results in\ngreater harm than abstention from right conduct, is\nnot to be forgotten. Of the thousand cows given away\nby a King, one cow was not his own. It is stated in the\nMahabharata (Anushasanika Parva, Chapter 70) that,\nfor the fault of having made the gift of a single cow\nwhich belonged to others, he had not only to forego\nthe merit of his other gifts but also to assume a low\nbirth in his subsequent life.\nSecondly, Yajnyavalkya mentions constancy in the\nwisdom of the Self. This constancy and the method of\nGayatri japa prescribed in the Sandhyavandana may\nbe said to be one and the same. As stated by Patanjali,\njapa has to be performed with a realization of its\nmeaning. The Gayatri mantra,  which has been\nexplained in the book on Sandhyavandana, embodies\nthe wisdom. Hence says Manu (vide Manu Smriti),\n\"The Gayatri should be understood to be the threshold\nof the Brahman\" (II-81).\nThe third duty  mentioned by Yagnayavalkya is\nhospitality. \"The guest should be looked upon as God,\"\nenjoins the Taittiriyopanishad. Manu exalts food left\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 20227\nover after satisfying the guest to the status of nectar\n(III-285). According to the Vedas as well as the\nBhagavad Gita (III-13), to eat food cooked for one's\nown sake is to eat sin. Manu goes so far as to say that\nin case the food is likely to prove insufficient for the\nguest, even the Vaishvadeva may be withheld, and\nthe food so saved should be served to him (III-108).\nBut as the selfsame Manu maintains that pretenders\nlike bogus Sanyasis should not be  entertained even\nwith mere words (IV-30), it is clear that it is necessary\nto see that the guest is a deserving person.\nIn the opinion of Yajnyavalkya,the fourth duty is\nshraddha or anniversary of death. Being an act done\nin a spirit of devotion to one's parents, this is named\nshraddha. Even in connection with marriage and other\nauspicious ceremonies the vridhhi nandi shraddha is\nprescribed as a means of maintaining the spirit of\ndevotion to ancestors. Hence it is not right to associate\nanything inauspicious with the very word shraddha.\nThe Taittiriyopanishad requires that parents should\nbe looked upon as God. Manu not only regards  service\nof parents as one's main duty, but declares that, so\nlong as they live, one should not abandon them and\nmake them seek the shelter of others (II-235). Who\ndoes not know the fact of Panduranga having stayed\nat Pandharpur in appreciation of Pundarika's\nabsorption in filial devotion? The Mahabharata\nnarrates how a Yogi who had reduced a poor bird to\nashes with his yogic power, was compelled to seek\ninstruction from a professional hunter who had himself\nobtained wisdom only through the service of his aged\nparents. To perform the anniversary of the death of\nthe mother who looked after the development of one's\nbody, as well as of the father who looked after the\ndevelopment of one's intellect in the earlier years, is\na matter of duty which at any rate serves to remind\none of their goodness. Recent researches of foreign\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 20228\nscholars confirm the Hindu religious belief that,\nalthough the soul which is deathless may abandon\nthe physical body, it retains the subtle body and\nremains subject to pleasure and pain. Hence\nanniversaries prescribed for the peace of departed\nsouls cannot be fruitless. As Manu has laid down that\nthere should be nothing very elaborate about these\nceremonies (III-126), it is obvious that one need not\nspend beyond one's means on this account.The fifth\nduty is truth which is one of the restraints mentioned\nin a previous discourse.\nMay all perform the yoga of action in this way and\nqualify themselves for liberation!\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

One has to go beyond\nthis state and reach the state of \"I am Brahman\" or\nAham Brahmasmi.\n(vii) Self-worship (Atmarchan). You must have read\nabout Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa who worshipped\nMother Kali. He took himself as Kali and worshipped\nhimself with kumkum etc.\n(viii) Vision of the Self (Atmanirupan).

The\nbody is there and it works but I don't see any duality.\n\"This  is the world and this is I\" kind of duality is\nnot perceived any longer. There is no separateness\nand the mind is at peace. Such a Yogi does work and\nsees the world as a dream or a movie. Just as we go to\na movie and laugh or cry even after paying money!\nWe know that we are apart from this picture, yet we\ncry and laugh. Likewise, a Yogi lives and works in this\nworld.\n(x) Final release  (Nirvan) This state cannot be\nexpressed in words. It has to be directly experienced.\nAfter explaining the above ten steps, Sage\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202211\nVashishta explains the four major means of Sadhana\n(Sadhana chatusthaya) which are also dealt with in\nthe Upanishads. They are:\n1) Discrimination between the Eternal and the\nnon-Eternal. That is Eternal (Nitya) which, once\nobtained, gives one complete satisfaction (Satwik\nSamadhan) and nothing more is necessary. Non-\neternal objects (Anitya) give temporary satisfaction,\ne.g. water quenches thirst but more will be needed\nwhen one again becomes thirsty; this water is non-\neternal. Supreme Brahman (Parabrahman) is eternal\nand no other pleasure is needed once you attain Him\n2) Dispassion towards fruits of one's actions in\nthis world and other worlds. The early ritualistic part\nof the Vedas prescribes many rituals like Ashwamedha\nYagna, Ganga-snan, etc. For gaining merit or for going\nto heaven etc. Vashistha says such pleasures are\ntemporary and, once our merit is exhausted, one is\nthrown out of heaven and back into this world. This\nshould not be misunderstood to mean that one should\nnot do rituals, acts of charity, Ganga-snan etc. but\nthat one should develop dispassion towards the\nenjoyment of the fruits of these actions. They don't\ngive 100 per cent satisfaction and we must understand\nthey are ephemeral.\nIn this connection, there is a beautiful story of the\nboy Nachiketa in Kathopanishad. He approaches Yama\nfor Self-knowledge (Brahmavidya). Yama offers\nNachiketa Apsaras, wealth untold, longevity,\nkingdoms and so many other things but Nachiketa\nrefuses all these. He wants nothing but Self-\nknowledge. Although a smallboy, Nachiketa had good\nupbringing, Samskar, and faith (Shraddha). He tells\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202212\nYama \"Finally, I have to come to you anyway and, so\nplease give me that knowledge right now.\" This is real\ndispassion. Any other  person would have been\nsatisfied with material gains and told himself that Self-\nknowledge can be looked into in old age!\n3) Desire for liberation (Mumukshutvam).\n4) Sixfold wealth. These are : (a) Shama : Control\nof the mind, intellect, ego etc. (b) Dama : Control of\nthe organs of perception and action. Even though the\nsense organs go after external objects, exercise control\nover them by great efforts : (c) Uparati : Self-withdrawal\nfollows naturally when Shama and Dama are\nmastered. (d) Titiksha :  Forbearance towards\nhappiness and sorrow; (e)Samadhan : a state of poise,\ntranquility and contentment. (f)Shraddha : We began\nour Pravachan with this topic and, finally, we arrive at\nthe same topic to conclude. In this connection, we\npropose to say a few words on devotion, Bhakti.\n(Continued...)\n01 THURSDAY RSHI PANCHAMI","type":"Document"}

This will bring down\nthe grace of the Guru on the aspirant.\n2.

P.\nSwamiji at Anandashram, Kanhangad on\nFebruary 20, 21 and 22, 2019.\n(As summarised in The Vision,\nApril 2019 issue)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202214\n3. In the Vedas we have the Karma Kanda, Upasana\nKanda and the Jnana Kanda:\n* Karma Kanda has rituals, Pujas etc. Most of\nwhat is Karma Kanda is not being observed\nany more. We have to do Karma Kanda\nbecause we have Kartritva (doership) and\nBhoktritva (enjoyership). Karma is defined by\nthese two factors.\n* Upasana is sitting in the presence of God. It\nis not a temporary or fleeting acquaintance\nwith God, it is the determination to\nunderstand our relationship with Him more\nclearly, because it becomes clear to the\naspirant that 'Aham' and 'Mama' - 'I' and\n'mine' - do not really help. This is called\nVairagya.\n* As Vairagya develops through intelligent\nthinking, the aspirant also develops Vishesha\nRaga - Bhakti - love for the Divine. This comes\nthrough the Punya of the past births and\nSatsang. Therefore, Satsang is extremely\nimportant.\n* Upasana is the process of acquiring the\nAnugraha of the Lord through our prayers\netc. and realising that the Divine is most\nimportant in our lives and that God is not a\nmeans to get other things in life.\n* When this understanding and maturity comes,\nthe way we approach God also will be different.\nThis comes after a lot of Tapas and Satsang.\n* Every human being has the ability to\ntransform the mechanical Karma into\nUpasana. Negligence can cause the Upasana\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202215\nto degenerate into Karma because Upasana is\ndesigned for Jnana. So, a fair amount of\nintrospection is required. In introspection we\nneed to know that 'yes, there are lacunae,\nthere are some things wrong in us, but this\nis not us. We don't want them, therefore. O\nLord, please remove them.' That is the\nconnection with Divine. Eventually everything\nwe do will become Upasana, it will have the\ntouch of the Divine. We will be able to be in\ncontact with the Divine in the most mundane\nactivities also.\n* Upasana becomes meaningful when it is\noriented towards the spiritual - Jnana. In\neverything that we do, we should get the bliss\nof having done it as Upasana with the right\nBhavana. Then when we sit and do Ram Nam\nwe should be able to do it even mentally.\n4) For dealing with the mind, we have to draw\nstrength and inspiration from the Divine.\n5) If we are asked to keep quiet and contemplate on\n\"who am I\", the mind will get baffled. It is only\naccustomed to thinking of itself by way of its\naccomplishments, failure or relationships. So, we\ntake a pause and say, \"I refuse to understand\nmyself by way of my accomplishments, failures\nor my relationships, I want to understand myself\nwith reference to my connection with You - God.\"\nThis should strengthen our relationship with God.\nStrengthening this connection, this identification,\nis very very important. Then whatever we do\nbecomes Upasana.\n(Courtesy: The Vision, April 2019)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

This is my considered\nopinion.\nNow, in the second shloka, we are given to see\nconsciousness activated; we listen to the cosmic\nmelodies emanating from it. From the essence we go\nto the expansion of consciousness. This verse takes\nup the issue of maya and explains the next step in\nthe focusing and intensification of consciousness.\nA suggestion of it was given in the last verse\nthrough the expression ujjrumbhana. But there the\nujjrumbhana or expansion was felt in the individual\nplane of the triple states of consciousness: Waking,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202219\netc. This individual experience is to be projected on\nto the cosmic screen, is to be cast in universal\ndimensions.\nExpanding Consciousness\nThe expanding universe is to be felt as a part of\nthe expanding consciousness--like a speck of flying\nfoam in the surging sea-surface. This calls for a deep\ninsight into life-process, an intuitive understanding\nof how the samvit thread becomes also the beads of\nworld-perception, how the mute string of samvit\nbreaks forth into the mellifluous music of embodied\nexistence. Otherwise, the I-experience of prajna will\nbe an isolated speciality against which the ordinary\nworld-experience will be ever in crusade. Therefore,\nfrom dridha-prajna , strong knowledge or\nunderstanding, of the first verse we switch on to\ndridha-mati, strong conviction, in the next.\n'I' identified\nIn Brahma eva aham--\"I am the Brahman only\",\nthe 'only' eliminates in the other things expressed\nexplicity in the previous sholka asC/M3eJemleg, drishyavastu.\nThis Brahma eva aham is also a restatement of sa-\neva-aham of the last verse, with the slight change\nfrom the feminine gender to the neutral. Instead of\nsamvit, here it is Brahman with which 'I' is identified.\nThis is significant. Because this leads to Fob peie(r)(r)e mekeAueb\nDenb, \"I am also all this world.\"\nThe first half of the shloka indirectly gives us\ndefinition of mati, conviction. Prajna must expand\ninto mati. Prajna is the first form if the Guru that\nis received through the sadhana, called shravana in\nVedantic terminology. The second form of the Guru\nis developed from this through the sadhana of\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202220\nmanana. The word mati in this verse refers to this.\nThis has to be properly understood.\nFirst of all, it has to be remembered thatshravana\nis not hearing something, getting some information\nstuffed within you, as is usually understood.\n\"Jiva is consciousness identified with the body.\nIshvara is consciousness identified with the universe.\nTherefore, Jiva minus body, and Ishvara minus\nuniverse, will be a perfect equation of consciousness\"-\n- this is what an ordinary student ofshravana usually\nachieves. But you must save yourself from this.\nMinusing is not your work. Time will do that. You\nare not to imitate time but to follow it smilingly. For\nthis you must have understanding. In fact when I\nask in the middle of a talk, \"Do you follow me?,\" I\nrefer to your understanding of me.\nTime--Terrible Master\nUnderstanding is true following. In case of time,\nto understand it you will have to master it. Time is\na servant who goes in front cleaning your path. But\nif you lack understanding, it will turn into a tyrant,\nassume the role of the master, a terrible master, and\ndrag you. Understanding makes the difference.\nManana is a process which bridges the moments\nof meditation across hours of so-called distraction. If\nyou truly know how to meditate, then every time you\ncome out of meditation you will find a new world\ngreeting you, a new phase of life, a new problem. No\nthumb rule of philosophy or sadhana-routine will\nwork even for a single week of human existance.\n(Continued...)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar,\nMt.

Pandurangashram Swamiji (1847-1915)\nJaishankar Bond I, Delha i\nSaints and spiritual leaders have their own way of\ncommunicating and facilitating events. I saw this from personal\nexperience in the recent past, when a series of interconnecting\nevents led me to what the title of this article says.\nA series of fortuitous events led to a vintage formal portrait of\nH.H. Pandurangashram Swamiji coming to my attention from a\ndistant land, doubtless by His Grace! Let me explain. I have, for\nquite some time now, been in touch with an academic focusing on\nSouth Asian H istory and Civilizations at a European University\n(Lausanne, Switzerland), Dr.Philippe Bornet, (courtesy Dr. Frank\nConlon's good offices). Dr. Bornet was working on the Malabar\narea, and we had, as students of history, exchanged notes on\nmaritime trade, inland economic and social developments in\npeninsular India 18th /19th century, and allied subjects.  All these\ndiscussions were online, naturally, as this was a time of global\nlockdowns. With prolonged contact, we became good friends.\nSomewhere along the line, I recall him asking me if I was a TamiI\n(maybe from the name now made famous in quite another\ncontext). In response, I had explained to him my Chitrapur\nSaraswat origins, mentioning that the successive line of our\nspiritual leaders was centered at Shirali in North Karnataka. I had\nals o  d e s c r ib e d  h im  t h e  h is t o r y  o f  c o m m u n it y\nmigrations/movements from North India to the coastal South\nWest.\nIn course of his researches, Dr Bornet had come across a\nGerman missionary tract that detailed out religious practices and\nhad accompanying photo-engravings covering different religious\npractices/religious leaders across the world. This tract, circa 1883,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202224\nwas titled \"Bilden Tafeln zur Landen-und Volken-Kunde\" (lit)\n\"Image Panels on Geography and Ethnology\" with a number of\nphoto engravings of religious figures and practices, with brief\ncommentaries on each. [I will allude to the commentary later in\nthe article] The Church perhaps created this book for their own\nknowledge and internal education. In this tract, Dr. Bornet had\ncome across a portrait of a religious leader captioned\nOne look at the portrait,\nand I knew, to my delight,\nt h a t  i t  w a s  o u r\nPandurangashram Swamiji!!\nWhen I confirmed it was, he\nspontaneously asked me if I\nwanted a print of the\npicture. He said he could get\nany size printed as they had\nthe equipment. I chose\npaper of A2 size as appropriate for Swamiji`s portrait, and in due\ncourse this photo, beautifully printed and packed, winged its way\nto Delhi from Lausanne.\nI had this portrait framed professionally by a photo framer\nwho works for art exhibitions and was wondering how to send it\nacross to H.H. Sadyojat Shankarashr am Swamiji and the\nSangrahalaya at Shirali, when behold! H.H. Swamiji`s visit to Delhi\nenroute Haridwar was announced, and it all seamlessly fell into\nplace. The portrait was handed over personally by me to H.H.\nSadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji, (as it happened on June 1, 2022\n- the day of H.H. Pandurangashram Swamiji`s Samaradhana and\nHe was very pleased to receive it.

A true Homecoming!!\nOn all counts, Pandurangashram Swamiji was a remarkable\nfigure----the first of our Swamiji-s who had His picture taken so His\nmessage and mission could be seen and felt even by those who\nhad never met Him. In an age of difficult communications,\n(remember it was the 19th century) particularly in the tough Ghat\narea of North Karnataka, He undertook a long and arduous\njourney all the way to Prayag, Kashi and Gaya (the Tristhali) taking\nadvantage of newly built rail links (B.B.and C.I.) from South-West\ncoast to the Ganga valley areas. He laid the foundations of a\nmodern se lement at Shirali, expanding the Math, giving it a firm\nfoundation, literally and figuratively. After extensive repairs to the\nmain Math structure, it is surmised that a stone slab bearing the\ninscrip on \"Shri Krshnashram Prasada\" was placed over the\nportico. This has been there for long; perhaps H.H.\nPandurangashram Swamiji may have named the structure after\nHis Guru. Inside the Math too, Samadhi-s of His predecessor\nGuru-s, as existent, were repaired, as were many subsidiary\nshrines around, giving Chitrapur the status of a \"Kshetra\". The\nShivganga Sarovara and Panchavati constructions also cameup in\nthis era. Besides, He arranged for a post office, a school and a\nmarketplace (weekly hat) to be set up at Shirali for convenience of\nresidents and visitors. He frequently travelled the Kanara-s, and\nonce even to Calicut (Kozhikode), to maintain close contact with\nthe Math cons tuents. Presiding over, and taking interest in\nfrequent Mahasabha-s, He was able to put the Math finances on a\nsound footing, and (very early, 1862) persuaded His Guru, H.H.\nKrshnashram Swamiji, to inaugurate the Rathotsava for the first\nme in Math history, which over the years, became a major socio-\nreligious event in the Community calendar, adding to the\npopularity of the Math. Revived again by H.H. Parijnanashram\nSwamiji III in the last century, Rathotsava continues to be a major\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202226\ndraw for not only our community (both local and abroad) but\nmany non-Amchi-s in the surrounding areas. (vintage KSA\njournals mention that photographs of Pandurangashram Swamiji\n(at nominal price) were freely available at the venue of\nRathayatra-s even in the 19th century, thus increasing His\npersonal accessibility.)  In popular thought, the Swamiji has also\nbeen widely revered as an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya.\nThe portrait installed in Gallery D of the  Shrimat Parijnanashram\nVastu Sangrahalaya, Shirali\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202227\nAs the biographer of H.H. Pandurangashram Swamiji, (late)\nDr. Gopal S. Hattiangdi, notes in his work \"Pandurang,\nPandurang\"(1965) - \"with all these qualities, He (H.H.\nPandurangashram Swamiji) can be thought of as \"a master mind,\na born genius and a great reformer\" - the qualities we also see\nmirrored eminently in His successor (twice removed),H.H.\nSadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji.\nTo revisit the brief commentary that accompanies the vintage\nportrait of H.H. Pandurangashram Swamiji, the missionary tract\nsays \"the person depicted here is the Guru of the famous and rich\nChitrapur Saraswat Brahmin Math, Swami Pandurangashram\". It\ngoes on to state that \"the Guru was well known for having turned\nthis location (Shirali) into a \"modern and widely successful\npilgrimage site\".\nI recall, with reverence, that the very first book Shantish Nayel\nan d  I  c o llab o rate d  to  d ig it is e  f o r  t h e  w e b s ite\nwww.ChitrapurEbooks.com a decade ago, bringing a different and\nrefreshing experience to us both, was 'Panduran g, Pandurang'.\nThe website is still a work in progress, by the abiding Grace of the\nGuruparampara.\nWhenever you visit the Shrimat Parijnanashram Vastu\nSangrahalaya at Shirali, do view this vintage portrait and its\naccompanying description.\nThere is no need of any other discipline. Let your\nheart be always attuned to Him. Offer Him your\nbody and mind always with love.\n- Swami Pandurangashram\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

The Yuva-s were divided into\ntwo groups. Each group had to appoint a Robot.\nThe game was to create a new innovative language\nand \"program\" their respective Robots accordingly.\nAn interesting twist and fun was infused later into\nthe game as the Robots were interchanged and the\ngroups were given only 2 mins time to teach the\nnew Robot assigned to their groups, the language\ntheir group innovated. A list of items was given to\nboth teams separately, and the groups had to\ninstruct the Robots in the language they innovated\nto get items in the same order as mentioned in the\nlist. The key to win this game was to effectively\ncommunicate with the Robot in their respective\ninnovative language and be the first Group to fetch\nall the items on the list. After the game was over,\nYuva-s & Yuvati-s each spoke and shared feedback\nabout the principles applied to play this game.\nThey analyzed the game and introspected on\nlessons learnt from this exercise. It was followed by\nDeepanamaskar, Devi Pujanam and Ashtavedan\nseva. The sense of peace that pervaded within us\nwhen the mantras were chanted, was unparalleled.\nThis splendid day ended with an interaction with\nParama Pujya Swamiji, wherein the game was\ndiscussed and introspected. HH Swamiji discussed\nhow team work played an important role in our\nrespective work lives. HH Swamiji shed light on\nadapting to a new environment and how Japa and\nAnusmarana help us maintain our poise.

Exercises on\nthe swiss ball by Smita Nayampalli pachi added an\nextra \"bounce\" to the day. After breakfast, Yuva-s\nmoved to the stage area for Deepa Prajwaalanam\nin the presence of HH Swamiji, for the official\ninauguration of the Sammelanam. Aditya\nChandavarkar (Chief Co-ordinator, CYO) welcomed\nthe Yuva-s and briefed everyone on what to expect\nin the Sammelanam. HH Swamiji then blessed the\nYuva-s and Sadhaka-s presentwith an Ashirvachan\nin which HE enlightened us with the meaning of\nshibir and importance of spiritual well-being and\ninner strength - ATMABAL. HE explained how\nyouth is an important phase of life where we can\naspire and grow in all aspects with a positve outlook.\nHH Swamiji mentioned how Japa and Anusmarana\nhelp us strike a balance in life and inculcate\nalertness and inner strength. The technique of\nPranayama was discussed. Its benefits to physical\nand mental health inspired all the Yuva- to practice\nit regularly. HH Swamiji also introduced Yuva-s to\nthe SHAKTI MANTRA, and elucidated its importance\nand benefits. The Ashirvachana concluded with the\nBhajan, Guru Mahima.

As part of the set for this interesting\ngame, a certain number of bricks were laid on the\nfloor in a pattern and the center brick was\nhighlighted. The Groups were to crossover to the\nother end. Group members were required to hold\nhands while crossing over and the rule was each\ngroup member should have their legs on the bricks\nat all times. As the Group progressed in crossing\nover through the laid bricks, some of the bricks\nwere being removed. The Groups were given an\nhour to complete the task. In the end all the Yuva-\ns analyzed this amazingly fun game and\nintrospected on lessons learnt.\nLater the same day, a very captivating session\nof Sanskrit Sambhashanam was conducted by\nShilpa Mudur pachi. 3 groups were created and\neach group was given an envelope with 15 chits\nwith certain words written on it. A time limit of 15\nminutes was set and the Groups had to use words\nmentioned on the chits to guess the story. The\nstory was about the Almighty Trinity; Brahma-\nVishnu-Mahesh. After this short exercise, the Yuvas\nperformed a short fun-filled skit directed by Shilpa\npachi. Shilpa pachi also helped with Sanskrit\ndialogues for this skit. This was followed by\nDeepnamaskar, Devi Pujanam, Ashtavadan Seva and\nPrasad bhojan.\nDay 3 (August 15, 2022); hearts filled with\npatriotism, all Yuvas were super energetic as they\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202234\nattended the 75 th Independence Day programme at\nthe 'Shri Parijnanashram Vidyalaya' in Karla.

After\nthe Flag Hoisting and program, all headed back to\nthe Math, followed by a very innovative tri-coloured\nbreakfast. The boys were directed to the Nagalaya\nfor Gayatri Anushthan, which was conducted by\nMohit Karkal mam, and the girls were directed to\nthe the ashram for Devi Anushthan, which was\nconducted by Smita Nagarkatti pachi.\nLater the same day, Yuvadhara collectively\noffered devotional Bhajan Seva at the lotus feet of\nParam Puja Swamiji during Paduka Pujan in the\nMath. All the Yuva-s & Yuvati-s also performed the\nPaduka Pujan and then had Prasad Bhojan.\nPost lunch the Yuva-s enjoyed an interesting\nsession organized by Dr. Gaurish maam. As part\n1 of a series of sessions, consisting of skillful,\ndelicate yet beautiful Sanjhi Art. All the Yuva-s were\nthrilled to learn this new art.\nLater the Yuva-s enjoyed a lecture and\ndemonstration on juggling and slacklining by\nOmkar Dhareshwar maam in the presence of HH\nSwamiji. The session was full of learnings as Omkar\nmam discused the physical and mental benefits of\njuggling he discovered during his practice of the\nsport. He punctuated how juggling provided physical\nbenefits, like upper body strength, balance and\nincreases stamina and body awareness and trains\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam August 202235\nour peripheral vision.

Yuva-s also tried their\nhand at Juggling and Slacklining.\nAs a perfect culmination to a fun-filled day 3\nof this Sammelanam, Yuvadhara members were\nblessed with yet another interaction session with\nParam Pujya Swamiji. With souls soaked in divine\nair, after another blissful interaction session with\nbeloved Param Pujya Swamiji, the Yuva-s then\nparticipated in Deepnamaskar, Shiv Pujan,\nAshtavadan Seva in the Math.

Everyone\ndesires happiness. Everyone pursues happiness. But\nnot everyone succeeds to the extent he desires. The\nfact is that what we believe to be happiness is not\nreal happiness. Hence even if we get the particular\nthings we desire, we do not secure lasting happiness\nthereby.\nIn the universe there is a twofold division - Atma\n(Parabrahma) and Anatma (Prapancha). The former\nis also termed chetana, while the latter is referred to\nas jada (inert). Happiness is related really to\nParabrahma. The nature of Parabrahma is threefold-\nSat (existence). Chit (knowledge) and Ananda (bliss).\nThis last is the real happiness.\nPrapancha consists of nama (name) and rupa\n(form). It has no real existence; it is like the proverbial\nreflection of the money-bag in the mirror. So the\nhappiness which we believe to be derived from\nprapancha is not in any way connected with it. There\nis the instance of the dog and the bone, which brings\nhome the truth to us. The bone smells of blood but\ndoes not contain any blood. The dog is carried away\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI ANANDASHRAM\nTHE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS\n(Delivered at Puttur in December 1938, and\npublished in Kanara Saraswat in March 1939)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 20229\nby the smell and chews the dry bone. Its hardness\nhurts the dog's teeth which begin to bleed. The dog\nthen sees and tastes real blood which, however, it\nbelieves to be the blood yielded by the bone. Its\nappetite is thereby whetted, and it continues to chew\nthe bone more and more vigorously. Just so is the\nhappiness we believe we derive from the physical\nworld.\nThis world is not the real seat or source of\nhappines. If it is, it should be so with respect to the\npast, the present and the future alike. Also it should\nbe sweet to all. But what was sweet yesterday may\nbe bitter tomorrow, and what is sweet to one is bitter\nto another, and vice versa.\nWe know what great happiness is given by\nsushupti or dreamless sleep. Whence does it come?\nSuch sleep postulates the total exclusion of the outer\nworld and the objects of so-called enjoyment. If it is\nthese objects that yield the happiness, how can sound\nsleep produce such happiness? The truth is that,\nduring sound sleep, the mind is merged into the\ninmost self, the Atma. That is where the happiness\ncomes from. We have to grasp this secret.\nThe happiness which appears to be derived from\nthe pursuit of worldly pleasures is not real. Only\nthat is real happiness which does not have to depend\non the existence of any worldly objects. As it does\nnot depend on any such objects, it is permanent;\neven without the objects there is happiness.\nThe happiness supposed to be connected with\nenjoyment of objects of sense is not positive\nhappiness, but may, if at all, be regarded as negative\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202210\nin character, like getting rid of a burden, a trouble\nor an inconvenience. According to Bhartrihari, all\nso-called happiness is negative, like that derived by\nthe supply of water to a thirsty man or of food to a\nhungry one. It is thus only temporary. The thirst or\nhunger will return again and demand satisfaction\nonce more.\nBhartrihari says  also that even though we may\nguard a thing every carefully, we are apt to lose it\nsooner or later, Why not give it up then of our own\naccord? If we give it up ourselves, we shall not feel\nsorry at our want of it. That is therefore the better\nway. The joy derived from renunciation is permanent.\nThe joy of acquisition is temporary.\nHere is Shri Krishna's classification of the different\ntypes of happiness: \"That in which one by practice\nrejoices, and which puts an end to pain; which at\nfirst is as venom but in the end is as nectar: that\npleasure is said to be satvic, born of the blissful\nknowledge of the Self. That which from the union of\nthe senses with their objects, at first is as nectar,\nbut in the end is like venom, is accounted rajasic.\nThat pleasure which both at first and afterwards is\ndelusive of the self, arising from sleep, indolence and\nheedlessness, that is declared tamasic. \" (Bhagavad\nGita, XVIII-36 to 39).\nSatvic happiness is real. It cannot be acquired all\nat once but only gradually. There are obstacles in\nthe way. But what should we do? We should cultivate\ncontentment and peace of mind. The mind should b\ntrained to remain unperturbed under all conditions.\nThen we shall not be sorry even if what we desire\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202211\ndoes not come to pass. We have instances of saints\nwho have acquired that mentality. It is not therefore\nimpossible to train the mind in that way.\nA Sanskrit poet has observed that, in order to\nmake the objects of sense subservient to us, we must\ntrain our mind; it is like the case of the eye and the\nobject seen through the eye. If the object cannot be\nseen properly, the eye should be trained or corrected,\nand not the object. Hence train the mind. Learn to\nbe supremely indifferent to the result. Then there\nwill be no disappointment. As Shri Krishna has\ndeclared in the Gita (II-64 & 65), \"The disciplined\nself, moving among sense-objects with senses which\nare free from passion and hate, and perfectly under\nhis mastery, goeth to peace. In that peace, the\nextinction of all pains ariseth for him\". The\ntransformation of the mind is the important thing to\nbe achieved, not the transformation of external\nobjects.\nA feeling of universality (sarvatma-bhavana) should\nbe developed. There will then be no cause for pain.\nThe Paramatman is in everything and everybody. Such\na mentality naturally leads to public work. Mahatmas\nhave such a comprehensive attitude. They do not\ngrieve on any account. Mahatma Gandhi is an\ninstance. He engages himself actively in a number of\nactivities, but his activities are quite disinterested.\nHis work is vast, but he is tranquil. Public work\nconducted in this spirit comes under Dharma. The\nprinciples of Dharma are immutable, but the sphere\nof their application extends with the passage of time.\nKarma Yoga thus comprises, at the present day,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202212\nservice to one's motherland as well as service to the\nwhole world.\nDevotion is also very helpful. The highest type of\ndevotion is Atmanivedana or complete surrender of\noneself to God, reposing unquestioning faith and\nunwavering confidence in Him. Such an attitude\nsustains us in adversity. Kunti, the mother of the\nPandavas, is said to have prayed to Shri Krishna for\nrepeated calamities in order that she might thereby\nbe blessed with a vision of the Lord.\nMay the Paramatman give all of you that tranquil\nattitude which helps to face difficulties with\nequanimity and steadily pursues the one true path\nleading to perpetual happiness in Self-realisation!\nMarch 2022","type":"Document"}

When we are in the mother's womb.\nwe say 'I AM THAT' (Soham) but once we are out of\nthe womb and perceive this bewildering world, we\nsay 'WHO AM I?' (Koham). We get enveloped by\nIgnorance. Either we cry or make others cry or others\nmake us cry!\nAs we grow, we get entangled in outer experiences\nand our sense organs fall a victim to their\nenchantments. If we find something pleasurable\ntoday, tomorrow we will turn to the same thing. When\nthis is repeated indefinitely, attachment ( sanga) to\nthat pleasure develops. One goes after beautiful\nwomen, another after gold, wealth, etc. This is\nbondage because these attachments never give you\ncomplete satisfaction or contentment ( Satvic\nSamadhan), however much one may indulge in them.\nThey yield only temporary pleasure ( anitya sukha).\nEverlasting joy ( nitya sukha) is gained only by the\ncompany of the wise ( satsang). This is what Kapila\ntold his dear mother.\nWhat is Sanga (attachment)?\nSanga means attachment to worldly pursuits and\nobjects. This should be given up and one should\nenquire on such lines as : Who am I? Where did I\ncome from? Who is the Guru? etc. Attachments have\nbeen built up over countless past lives.

It\nis bheshajam (remedy, medicine), says above Shloka.\nMany call themselves as saintly. How to\ndistinguish between those who really are Santa and\nthose who are not?

Some are by nature critical. Others\nunquestioningly accept whatever they are told. In\nthe passage just quoted, the former see a conflict\nbetween man's nature and free will. Even if a man\nout of his free will resolves not to do a thing, if his\nnature will make him do it, is there any scope for\nethical preaching or right conduct? And how can he\nbe held responsible for his deeds?\n    According to our Dharma, there are three factors\ngoverning all action, namely, free will, karma and\nthe divine will. There is a school of thought based\nsolely on free will. It discards the theory of previous\nbirths. But we discern a relationship of cause and\neffect in everything in this world. We have to presume\nthe existence of a primary cause for all phenomena\nincluding the differences between the different things\nor beings we meet with. The hypothesis of previous\nbirths and the theory of karma help to explain such\ndifferences satisfactorily. Every individual soul\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n              - Shalini, Uma & Arun Bolangdy.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         4                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nacquires certain experiences and becomes endowed\nwith certain tendencies as a result of what it passes\nthrough in each of its births, and it is only the next\nnatural and logical step to believe that the nature of\neach such soul will be influenced by the stock of\nexperiences and tendencies thus acquired.\n    We are also forced to the conclusion of the\nexistence of a Being governing the universe. We see\nvarious laws operating in the universe. There must\ntherefore be a Being responsible for those laws. This\nBeing is called Ishavara in our Dharma. Such a Being\ncannot but have a will of Its own. This was what we\nmeant when we referred to the divine will.\n    There is also a school of thought which accepts\nthe theory of the divine will as the sole factor in the\nuniverse. But such a theory is also open to objection.\nWe see that some are happy, while others are not. Is\nit not injustice? Does it not indicate partiality? And\nwhat may be the reasons for such difference of\ntreatment? Another objection is that acceptance of\nthe theory will engender a thoroughly helpless and\nslavish mentality.\n    The acceptance of the karma theory alone as the\nsole factor is similarly open to objection. If what we\nnow see is solely the result of past deeds, how can\nwe account for the variations in the past deeds of\ndifferent individuals, which are now manifesting\ndifferent results?\n    We cannot therefore accept any one of the three\nfactors as the sole one. We have to assume the\nexistence and operation of all three of them. Some\nconflict may perhaps be apparent amongst them. We\nhave to resolve it. Let us see what our Scriptures\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         5                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nsay.\n   According to the            Koushitaki Upanishad,\n\"Whomsoever the Lord decides to lift upwards, by\nhim He causes good deeds to be performed.\nWhomsoever He resolves to push down, by him He\ncauses bad deeds to be performed.\" (III-9). On the\nother hand, the   Brihadaranyakopanishad says : \"Man\nis full of desire. His inclinations will be shaped by\nhis desires. His deeds will be shaped by his\ninclinations. And he will reap the fruit suited to his\ndeeds.\" (IV-4 & 5). While the former passage gives\nprominence to the divine will, the latter makes the\nindividual's desires the cause of whatever good or\nevil befalls him.\n   In the   Gita, Shri Krishna, persuading Arjuna to\nfight and kill his foes, goes to the length of saying :\n\"By me they are already overcome. Be thou the\noutward cause, O dexterous one.\" (XI-33). Here also,\nthe divine will seems to be made almost the one\nfactor which counts. This is emphasised again in\nanother verse : \"The Lord dwelleth in the hearts of\nall beings. O Arjuna, by his Maya causing all beings\nto revolve as though mounted on a machine.\" (XVIII-\n61). This immediately follows the verse quoted at the\nbeginning. Thus in two successive verses, prominence\nhas been given to nature and to divine will\nrespectively. We should not therefore regard the two\nviews as contradictory, but as supplementary and\nmeant to lead to a single conclusion, namely, the\nneed for doing one's duty.\n   The   Gita has passages pointing to free will also :\n\"Let the self be raised by itself; let not the self be\nallowed to be depressed. The self alone is the friend\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        6                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nof itself, and the self alone its enemy. To him that\nhath conquered himself, the self is his friend. But to\nhim that hath not so conquered, the self is his\nenemy.\" (VI-5 & 6). This is further proof of the fact\nthat, in order to drive home the same lesson to\nArjuna, Shri Krishna has advanced different\narguments at different times.\n    A man's nature, as we have stated already, is\nbuilt upon the stock of experiences and tendencies\nacquired by him as a result of his previous births.\nThis is called  prarabdha. It is the stock of his previous\nkarma with which he starts a new birth. But it does\nnot stand in the way of his doing any good deeds in\nthe course of that new birth. As a result of the nature\ndeveloped in human beings, some have leanings\ntowards good and some towards evil. This nature is\nof three broad types, satvic, rajasic and tamasic, and\na detailed description of these will be found in\nChapters XVII and XVIII of the           Gita. Chapter XVI\nsets out the attributes of the divine nature and its\nopposite.\n    As a result of deeds performed in previous births,\nman is born in a particular grade or class of society.\nSuch grades have been broadly classified into four\nmain types, namely, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya\nand Shudra, and the main characteristics pertaining\nto each of these types have been mentioned in the\nGita (XVIII-42 to 44). They constitute, so to say, the\ntype of mentality of the individuals born in the\nrespective classes. Within the limits marked out by\na person's nature, there will be enough freedom left\nto him to do good deeds or bad deeds according to\nhis discretion. When this is understood, it will be\nseen that a man's nature or karma need not stand\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         7                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nin the way of his doing or not doing any particular\nthing. Even nature can be gradually changed by\nconstant, earnest, sedulous endeavour.\n    This view may not appear correct at first. Shri\nKrishna Himself has raised the question in the              Gita\n: \"Even the man of knowledge behaves in conformity\nwith his own nature; beings follows nature; what\nshall restraint avail?\" (III-33). If restraint be of no\navail, will preaching be of any avail? But in the very\nnext verse, the Lord says : \"Affection and aversion\nfor the objects of sense abide in the senses; let none\ncome under the dominion of these two : they are\nobstructors of the path.\" So we have His authoritative\npronouncement that to submit or not to submit rests\nwith ourselves.\n    It is stated in the  Yajnyavalkya Smriti that success\nis achieved by both    daiva ( purva karma) and      pourusha\nacting in cooperation.       God helps those who help\nthemselves. What is required is sustained exertion\nin the proper direction. If it is maintained that God\ndoes everything and that man has no freedom in any\nmatter, it would be ascribing to God both cruelty\nand partiality. Hence the       Brahmasutras declare that\nGod distributes rewards strictly according to deserts\nand merit (II-1-34). From this it is clear that there is\nscope for doing good deeds out of one's own free will.\n    In doing good deeds, we may have to select such\ndeeds as are in conformity with our nature, suited to\nour status, condition and circumstances in life. Place,\ntime and occasion must also be taken into account.\nWe have to follow the line of least resistance. Going\nagainst the current is more difficult than going with\nit. But even when going with the current, we need\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         8                  January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nnot be mere passive agents : we do have some freedom\nto do what good we can. Sometime, perhaps, we\nmay, with extraordinary effort, succeed in going, at\nleast for some distance, against the current. Even\nso, evil can be resisted or fought with effort. In certain\nconditions, we may well take advantage of our very\nnature for doing good. In certain others, we may get\nthe better of our nature and do good.\n    Thus nature, the divine will and the human\nwill can all be made to co-operate with one\nanother. None of them operates to the complete\nexclusion of the other two.\n    May Providence grant you the ability and the\nunderstanding to grasp this problem aright, to resolve\nthe apparent conflict satisfactorily, and to do good in\nspite of the obstacles in your way!\n\n               FESTIVALS IN FEBRUARY 2022\n\nFebruary 2022\n03  Thursday              Samaradhana at Mallapur -\n                          Swami Shankarashram-II Sannidhi\n07  Monday                Rathasaptami, Guruprapti Divasa\n10  Thursday              Vardhanti at Shirali - Sannidhis of\n                          Bhuvaneshvari, MahaGanapati, Shri\n                          Shankaracharya, Paduka Sannidhi\n                          of Swami Parijnanashram-III and Shri\n                          Ramanjaneya\n19  Saturday              Vardhanti at Mangaluru -\n                          Shri Venugopala Sannidhi\n21  Monday                25th Pattabhisheka Vardhanti. of\n                          P.

H. gave us a booklet\ncalled Kapilopadesha with Hindi commentary. It\noccurs in the third part (        skandha) of Bhagawat\nPurana. It contains a story of Devahuti, daughter of\nManu and Shataroopa. Devahuti was married to\nKardama and they led a life of righteousness.\nKardama led the life of an ascetic, totally devoted to\nspiritual life. Before marriage, Kardama had informed\nManu and Shataroopa that he was not interested in\nmarriage for the sake of sense pleasures, but only to\nbeget a child after which he would take to\nVanaprastha or Sanyasa. It was on this condition\nthat Kardama married Devahuti and, even after\nmarriage, carried on austerities for many years. All\nthis time, Devahuti served Kardama with great\ndevotion. Pleased with his wife's service, Kardama\noffered her a boon. Devahuti asked for a son - not\nan ordinary one, but a wise one, a Jnani. In course\nof time, a wise son Kapila was born to Devahuti and\nKapila, the son, became the Guru of his mother\nDevahuti. Our purpose in narrating this story is to\nillustrate that a Guru can be young too.\n            efveefJe&CCee efvelejeb Yetceved Demeefoefve3eleHe&Ceeled~\n        3esve mecYeeJ3eceevesve He'HevveevOeb lecee He'Yees~~3-25-7~~\n              DeLe ces osJe mecceesnced DeHeeke=A<igb lJecen&efme~\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        10                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\n3eescJeie'nescnb cecesleerl3esleefmceved 3eesefpelemlJe3ee~~3-25-10~~\n                    leb lJee ieleenb uejCeb uejC3e\n            mJeYe=l3emebmeejlejese kegAthejced~~3-25-12~~\n    Thus, Devahuti surrenders to her son Kapila, her\nGuru, and says: \"Your father's knowledge and fruits\nof austerities have been inherited by you. Although\nI was with him for a long time, I have not got that\nknowledge. Though you are my son, you are very\nwise and I am a worldly person and am ignorant. I\nhave now come to know that sense organs repeatedly\ndemand satisfaction, but are never completely\nsatisfied. There is no permanent happiness (              nitya\nsukha) in this world, but only desires and\nexpectations. I am disillusioned, please remove this\nattachment. I surrender to you. Please save me from\nthese problems of Samsara. Please uproot this tree\nof Samsara.\"\n    Kapila agreed to his mother's request and gave\nher a sublime discourse. We will take up a few points\nfrom his Upadesh for our discussion.\nGood Company (Satsanga)\n    It is of utmost importance that one seeks the\ncompany of the wise and the seekers of God. You\nnow say that your mind is disturbed and so is afraid\nof the world. The same mind and intellect, which\nnow cause disturbance to you, can lead to liberation\nif they are employed as means of Self-Enquiry.

The world suddenly turns\ninto a living classroom for this new spiritual sadhaka.\nThe hermitage is in rugged terrain and the dense\njungle towards which the master is taking him is a\nfew hundred meters away. The crisp evening breeze,\nthe mellowing sunlight, the eagerness of the disciple\nand the smiling, but silent countenance of the master\ncombine to charge the air with a rare intensity. The\nsensitive student, quick to sense the power of these\nvibrations, is eagle-eyed and eager to grasp the tiniest\nwisp of wisdom that will emanate from the master.\n  As they walk towards the woods, the disciple starts\ntalking about his day. The master is          a good listener,\nnever interrupting and rarely commenting on what he\nhears. A visitor to the ashram has upset the sadhaka\nby his argumentative chatter. \"But I didn't retort or\nsay anything rude,\" he tells the master proudly. But\nsoon he passes judgment on the visitor's behavior. As\nhe over-analyses someone of little consequence to\nhimself, he is subconsciously enjoying the debunking\nhe is indulging in.\n  The master has ordered that he has to be quiet as\nthey enter the forest. So, he races to finish all he has\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         14                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nto say. But before his outburst is over, the master\nturns, looks at the shishya squarely in the eye and\npoints out, \"The most contaminating thing in this\nworld is dwelling upon other's faults.\" As he grapples\nwith the enormity of the lesson he has just learnt,\nthe sadhaka realizes the master is at the edge of the\n'silence zone'. Wordlessly, both enter the forest.\n  There is a deafening quiet. The senses till then\nswimming in multiple impressions before entering this\ngreen cavern, now forcibly yield to the natural alertness\none experiences when flung into unexpected situations.\nThe 'silence' is punctuated only by the sounds of the\nforest. The shishya has been told there are hungry\nand, therefore, angry bears in this forest. So the first\nreaction to the slightest sound is tinged with fear. But\nthen he assures himself he is in the company of his\nmaster, who knows the area well. His mind relaxes\nand he begins to hear the crunch of dry leaves, the\nscampering away of a squirrel, the swish of foliage as\na bird takes wing, the gurgle of a mountain spring -\nnoises that make him feel in tune with the environment.\n  The utter solitude seems to reduce the need for\ninane dialogue. The watchful sadhaka realizes the\nwalk is as much a test of physical stamina as it is\nan educational tour to sharpen the powers of\nperception and alertness. At one point, he playfully\nflings a tiny twig over his shoulder. That very instant,\nthe master turns with lightning speed to check on\nhis ward. The message goes home! From now on, the\nstudent has to sharpen his focus and response to\nouter phenomena, As they continue walking, the\nsadhaka realizes his normal fear of probable danger\nis reducing, thoughts are fading off, his inner silence\nis deepening as if in response to the quiet without.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         15                January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nA bear may still charge at them but the\napprehension has been replaced by a keen alertness\nthat is positive, strengthened, focused. He learns to\ntackle the external world- with preparation and\nprecision, not brooding or clinging to past conditioning\nor compulsions.\n  On another evening, the sadhaka is asked to take\nthe walk alone. He is suddenly acutely aware of his\nvulnerability. He creates signposts so that he does\nnot get lost. But half-way into the forest, he loses his\nnerve and filled with ugly anxiety, gallops back to\nthe ashram. The master says nothing. But the disciple\nis intuitive enough to understand that this aborted\nwalk is a test he still has to pass! Once again, he is\nasked to walk away by himself. But this time, he is\nprepared. He has a water bottle, a match-box and\nloads of resolve. His mind is steadier and he is  more\nconfident. He now finds the path familiar.\n  When he reaches a rocky clearing the forest opens\ninto, the elated disciple takes a slow, deliberate look\nat the valley below. He sits down to admire the view,\nshaking the rock he is sitting on. It does not budge-\nits solidity and stability echoing the balance and\nequipoise he feels within. He takes in the majestic\nview-the hills, the crimson of the dipping sun, the\npicture-book hamlet below; he recalls the first evening\nas he sat at the same spot with his master.\n  The master had pointed out that the village looks\nso beautiful only because it is so far away. Today,\nricher by his victory over crippling fear the disciple\nfinally deciphers the message. It is distance that lends\nenchantment to the view. Viewed from close, it would\nshow up its warts and spots! The sadhaka\nunderstands that without conscious distancing, he\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        16                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\ncannot be objective or be detached, so crucial for\nspiritual growth.\n  For a brief, immortal moment, he feels as if his\nname and form, his concerns, have been swept away\nand he is one with the all-pervasive energy that\nsurrounds him. This tatastya, the total stillness the\nmaster has been advocating-brings in its wake, an\nunshakeable calm.\n  He experiences total absorption, merging with the\nnatural glory and vitality around, of which he too is\nan indelible part. In that flash of recognition of the ill-\nencompassing manifestation of the Divine, there\nremain no divisions, no borders, no wall. There is\nonly rejoicing over the beauty and perfection that\nforever was, is and will be--- in the perceiver, in that\nwhich is perceived and in the act of perception. It is\na moment of perfect      'being' rather than     'becoming'.\nThe young sadhaka is ready for his inward journey.\n                           (Courtesy: The Speaking Tree)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         17                January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Some\npeople, when they are happy, violate dharma without\nany forethought. Some grieve excessively when they\nare afflicted by sorrow, thinking their misery is\npermanent.\n    There are some others who maintain equanimity\nin happiness as well as grief.

There was nothing on earth that could\nbear the onrush of grace except the             tapasya of\nMahadeva. The     jata is a symbol for  tapas. Similarly in\nour individual life,     titiksha or bearing with the\nvicissitudes of life -- honour and dishonour, heat and\ncold, joy and misery, will only help the       tapas.\n   The real significance of         tapas is to execute\nsvadharma in utter dedication. From the moment of\nhis birth, man is surrounded by rules. The ingredients\nfor his spiritual growth come speeding towards him.\nHe has to accept and react to them in tune with the\nDivine, which gives the soul the field and lays down\nthe laws of working.\n   If you follow the laws of    tapas, then you will have\nGod's strength infused into you. That process has\nbeen described in the latter half of the    Shvetashvatara\nmantra: \"tattvasya tattvena sametya yogam:\" \"One\nattains to   yoga, the pure awareness of the self\nidentified with God, who is projected as the reality of\nthe world\".\n   How is this attained? The           mantra cryptically\nanswers: Through the practice of the single, the twin,\nthe triple or the eight-fold path. Here we have a\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19                January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\ngraded course of      sadhana. For the most eminent,\nthe path of \"one\" which is an offering of oneself to\nthe Divine--Isvarapranidhana--is applicable. A very\nhighly evolved soul alone can do this in one stroke.\n    When this ripeness is lacking, the  two-fold path\ncomes to our help. Besides        Isvara comes Guru and\nwe have recourse to     Isvara Seva    and Guru Seva. But\nthis intimacy with the      Guru and the essence of the\nscriptures is also rather difficult. Therefore, it is\nadvisable to take up the three-fold path--shravana,\nmanana, nididhyasana-- needed to substantiate the\nGuru Upasana.\n    Shravana is a process of hearing the saying of\nthe scriptures. Thinking over them constantly is\nmanana. The next step is      nididhyasana--internalising\nit. It is a deep state of absorption, leading to revelation\nof the Eternal Reality. To achieve       nididhyasana, the\nentire  Ashtanga Yoga (the eight-fold) has to be put\ninto use. So, we find in this         mantra a telescopic\narrangement, one set of        sadhana sliding into the\ninterior. The eight-fold, culminating into the one -\nthe total giving-up.\nThe Six    Atmagunas\n    Acharya Shankara and other great Masters have\nconsistently upheld as the        atmagunas, a set of six\nqualities --shatsampatti. Shama, dama, uparati,\ntitiksha, shraddha and samadhana-- are the six\natmagunas, the six faces through which we have to\nsee Atman.\n    They can be considered in three pairs: The first\npair, shama and      dama, means control of the mind\nand the senses.    Uparati and    titikshna pertain to that\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        20                January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\npower through which we prevent frittering away of\nour energies, avoid the wastage incurred or damage\ndone to our psychic energy.              Shraddha        and\nsamadhana pertain to two powers-one of generation,\nthe other of concentration or absorption. All these\nare very essential for the flight of the soul towards\nthe Infinite.\n                  The Vision of the 'I'\n   In the context of the third        mantra of the sixth\nchapter of the   Shvetashvatara Upanishad, dealt with\npreviously we tried in the beginning to have a glimpse\nof the timeless as the seed of the Universe, of that\nwhich was when creation was not. This puts a great\nstrain upon our imagination. But when we come to\nwhat has been indicated in the        mantra that the seed\nof the Universe is verily the seed of the soul, your\nown self, then we try to see the timeless unchanging\nessence in the depth of our own being.\n   We found that this        mantra, in a nutshell, puts\nforth the entire     Samvit Sadhana, beginning with\ndedicated actions and culminationg in               yoga or\nrealisation of  the ultimate that is achieved through\nthe single, the double, the triple and the eight-fold\npath. We have already seen that before we start\nascending this stairway to freedom, we must strike\na mine of spiritual gems--the      shat-sampatti, and take\nthem with us to offer at the feet of the Divine. You\ncannot do it in a day or in a year or perhaps not\neven in a single birth.\nSelf-realisation\n   Nachiketa, going to the very limits of life, to the\nGod of death, asked him, \"What is             Atma?\" Yama\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        21                January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nanswered: \"Know what the Self is\".\n    Here in the Self we come to the unity in all beings-\n-the  fundamental unity where all questions cease,\nwhere all answers get a meaning and where the strife\nof life enters into an undisturbed peace. Therefore\nthere is one path, there is one method, which is\nattained in one moment. It is that moment of Self-\nrealisation. One moment, in which the scales fall off\nthe eyes and a new vision comes.\n    Self-realisation certainly is no day-dreaming. It is\na powerful perception that transforms the entire life,\nendowing it with a rare richness and stability.\n    We have already seen that          yoga is very much\nneeded to control the mind and the senses, each\nsense needing a particular practice of            yoga, each\nvasana needing a different treatment. Hence              yoga\ncannot be belittled. The      Yoga Vasishtha goes to the\nextent of placing it on the same pedestal as            jnana:\nTo arrive at the non-dual truth you must obliterate\nthe mind, the basis of duality. And this is achieved\nby a two-pronged means,         jnana   and yoga.\nSuperior Viewing\n    A superior form of seeing, when acquired, takes\naway the littleness of everything. Whatever your eyes\nalight upon is seen as the       Brahmna, the unlimited.\n    Let us consider the ego,  the expression of the 'I'.\nThrough a little   vichara, some reading and        satsanga,\nyour ego gets 'purified' enough not to confuse itself\nwith the gross body. But yet you do not quite\nunderstand what is really is. This \"I\" consciousness\ncan be flooded with \"light\" only through the            jnana\ndrishti.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        22                 January 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nWhen jnana drishti arises, you see your\nunqualified self like the unqualified space which\nexisted always.\n    Try to feel it by a turning-in of the attention.\nCatch hold of that inward movement of attention\nand practice a similar turning-in, to perceice the\nground of all perceptions. Just as you can, without\nlooking, feel you are sitting, try to feel you are that\nwhich has been untarnished by countless biths since\nthe ageless past. Thus all things become blissful.\n    The moment the \"I\" gets identified with the\nUpadhis, the appendages or instruments meant for\nthe working of that \"I\", then the sense of doership\nand duties arise. The father, the husband and the\nking--all these are forms of identified \"I\", the\nahankara.\n    In the Gita, the Lord says: \"Ahankara may prevent\nyou from accepting the truth of the real 'Aham' I am\nrevealing to you. Deprived of that truth, you will\nperish\".  Vairagya is the force of dispassion which\nwill help you to detach yourself        from  ahankara and\nall the modifications of the mind and senses.\n    When the ego is torn in one stroke, 'tattvena\nsametya  yogam' becomes possible. This stripping of\nourselves, of all  the trapping of the soul can be done\nwith one will, in one stroke. But, if the might for that\nwill is lacking, there are many things that go to\nstrengthen the will. We shall look at them now.\n                                                  (Continued)\n            (Courtesy :   Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt.

Even\nso, the hope that the purity of your hearts and your\ndevotion to the Guru might result in the propagation\nof Dharma, gave us courage to undertake the work\nof delivering religious discourses. It is stated in the\nMahabharata that Ekalavya, a Harijan, and others\nreached perfection through their devotion to the\nGuru, while Upamanyu, though working as a mere\ncowherd, attained his goal likewise. But today there\nis no question of imposing a ban on anybody like\nthe one placed on Ekalavya nor need one tend cows\nin the service of the Guru; nor, indeed, need any\none, like Upamanyu, offer all  his earnings to the\nGuru, quench both hunger and thirst with nothing\nmore than the juice of the       ravi plant, get blind, fall\ninto a well and so suffer.     If all paid vantiga at the\nrate of one per cent of income, the daily as well\nas the occasional services of the Math could be\nperformed without any anxiety, and the             sadhana\ncontemplated by us could be accomplished with\npeace of mind. As such payment did not seem\nlikely in present circumstances, it was proposed to\nstop the car festival, but this has given rise to agitation\nand to a demand for a Mahasabha which might cost\nalmost as much as a car festival itself.

He is not moved by the pairs of opposites\nthat beset us at every moment in life. His sahana-\nshakti is formidable. It is called Titiksha.\nCompassionate: His very look drips with compassion.\nThis reminds Us of a letter We wrote to His Holiness\nduring Chaturamas. His ailment was diagnosed as\n'enlargement of heart'. We wrote : \" Your heart is so\nlarge that all Saraswats know it; why did You have\nto have this heart of flesh enlarged?\"\nA friend of all beings  (suhridah sarvadehinaam) :\nGoodwill towards all and malice towards none. He is\nfriend and wellwisher to all men, women, old, young\nand  children,  animals,  etc.,  in  fact,  all  embodied\nbeings.\nHe has no enemies: (ajaatashatru) : He harbours no\nharm towards anyone in thought, speech or deed.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                               April 20229\n------- PAGE END -------\nPeaceful    (shaanta) :    A saint is always at peace with\nhimself and the world. Swamiji had several physical\nproblems-diabetes, chronic constipation, summer\nboils, etc. There were causes for mental anguish too.\nYet, His face was a picture of serenity. He always\nrevelled in the bliss of Self (Atma-sukha). On meeting\nHim, one wondered whether. He was in the body or\nestablished in His Nija-swarupa as the blissful Atman.\nPolite and sweet in speech           (saadhu-bhaashana) :         It\nis said of Sri Rama in Ramayana that whenever\nsomeone met him, he would always smile first and\nthen begin his conversation. Same was true of revered\nSwamiji. Whenever He had any visitor, He would\nsmile first and then tenderly enquire : How are you?\nWhen did you come? etc. A saintly person, (Saadhu)\ndoes not talk too much. His speech is a model of\nessence    (meejb), clear and well-said     (megag), concise and\nto the point    (efceleb)and sweet    (ceOeg).\nThe characteristics given in Bhagavata were there in\nfull in our revered Guru Swamy. He was, therefore,\ntruly a Saadhu par excellence.\nSome more characteristics are given in the holy books\nand they all came alive in the personality of\nGuruswamy. These lakshanas are:\n           JeCe&Oemeeo: mJejmeewyJeb (r)e ueIeglJeceejesi3eceueesuegHelJeced~\n                               Also\n                   HejesHekeAejefvejlees peHeHetpeeefolelHej:\n                   DeceesIeJe(r)evees Meevlees JesoJesoeLe&Heejie:\nVarnaprasada : Irrespective of what the colour of the\nskin is, one feels looking at a saint again and again.\nHe has such a pleasing appearance. There is another\nmeaning too. Varnaprasada means a pleasant diction.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam          10                     April 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nHe always speaks softly and sweetly.\nSvarasoushthava: He has a pleasing well-modulated\nvoice.\nLaghutvam: He has a light body. He ensures this\nwith his moderate diet.\nArogyam: He is healthy.\nAlolupatvam: He desires nothing. His needs are\nminimal.\nParopakaraniratha : His charity extends to all\ndeserving people     (melHee$eoeve). Our Guruswamy had a\nbit of income from daily Padapoojas and from\nthis He supported about four to five hundred\nneedy families. He never divulged this fact to\nanyone. We were greatly surprised to know this\nonly after His Mahasamadhi from a diary which\ncontained a list of these families. Some holy men\ndo use such income to built Ashrams, etc, but\nnot His Holiness.\nJapa-poojadi-tatparah: A saint is regular in Japa,\nPooja, etc. Here Japa does not necessarily mean the\nuse of rosary. Guruswamy did continuous             meescnbor\nDepeHeepeHe and meticulously performed Poojas especially\non a Punyatithi, Ganesh Chaturthi, etc.\nAmogha Vachana: He, the saint, always speaks\ntruthfully. His words never go in vain.\nShaanta: He is always a picture of serenity. Our\nGuruswamy, true to His Poorvashram name, was\nShantamoorty indeed.\nVeda Vedarthaparagah:       He is a master of Vedic lore.\nYou might have read in 'Fifty Years of Bliss' that His\nHoliness was an adept in all branches of Vedic\nlearning and the six systems of philosophy           (shad-\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       11                  April 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\ndarshana). Towards the end of His earthly sojourn,\nSwamiji had severe bouts of high blood pressure, a\nweak heart and breathing problems. Yet, He could\nbe seen brushing up a grammar text entitled 'Parama-\nlaghu-manjoosha' at the hands of Ved. Shri Anant\nshastri Phadke. Shastriji was no ordinary tutor. He\nwas  Head  of  Department  of  Purana  &  Itihasa,\nVaranasi Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya and had a string\nof  Degrees  to  his  credit  like  Vyakaranacharya,\nMimansa-Tirtha, Vedanta Kesari, etc. Daily, Swamiji\ndid His home-work (!) from 8 to 10 a.m. and studied\nagain in the evening and all this when He was almost\non His death-bed.Indeed, He remained a Vidyarthi\nunto the last.\n                                                 (to be contd.)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                               April 202212\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

P. SHRIMAT ANANDASHRAM SWAMIJI\n                   - LATE SHRI DINKAR V. KATRE\n    There  are  some  memories  that  time  cannot\ntarnish. Everyone of us possesses such memories -\nof people, places, things and to me my childhood at\nCalcutta (Kolkata) is one of the few memories that\nglow ever brighter with every passing year.\n    Never before in the history of the Math had the\nBhanap  community  been  scattered  so  wide;  and\nnever before in that history had any other Swamiji\ntravelled  then  so  far  and  so  much:  Bombay,\nRishikesh,  Calcutta,  Jamshedpur,  Banaras,  Gaya,\nCuttuck, Madras, Cape Comorin and Bangalore being\njust a few points of the compass touched, but gives\nan idea of the range covered. Wherever Pujya Swami\nAnandashram went, He put His disciples at ease; He\nappreciated their difficulties; His manner was always\naccommodating and His words were indeed always\nmost comforting.\n    Our revered Param Pujya Anandashram Swamiji\nwas gracious enough to pay five visits to Calcutta\nand its environs to meet the Bhanap laity viz., 4\ndays in January, 1938, two weeks during January,\n1950, a week around October, 1954, the fourth being\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

However only a few\nmemorable and joyous incidents of the visits which\ncome to my mind's eye are recorded herewith.\n    It was around 5th to 9th January, 1938 period,\nas far as my memory goes (I was then 6 years old!),\nas we all bhanaps of Calcutta had assembled at the\nresidence of Shri Hemmad Shantaram (Babudimam)\nat Beltatala Road, Bhawanipur, were waiting patiently\nsince early morning for the arrival of Pujya Swamiji\nand his retinue from Howrah Station. The Calcutta\nBhanaps, one and all, were never before so stirred,\nthe best in them was never before so well called for\nas then. Pujya Swamiji's visit brought about a joyous\nand charged atmosphere of festivity. Puja, Arathi,\nPadapuja, Bhiksha and the Ashtavadhan Puja were\nceremoniously performed by the Vaidiks and the\nlaity - a sight to be remembered and heard.\n    Though Pujya Swamiji's visit was brief, it had left\nan impression of faith in God. It might be said of the\nSwamiji that He came, He saw and He conquered.\nWith the day of His departure close at hand and\nwhen the time came for His departure, there was\nnot one Bhanap man or woman who did not wish\nPujya Swamiji had stayed longer with us! Babudiman\n(being a film industry doyen) had arranged to record\nPujya Swamiji's first visit to Calcutta through a black\nand white movie film roll specially arranged and\nwhich must be in the archives of Shri Chitrapur\nMath, Shirali.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        9              September 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe other visit which I remember of Pujya Swamiji\nwas of 7 days around October, 1954, when He\ncamped at the residence of Shri Shivashankar\nHemmady at Bakulbagan Road, Kalighat. The\neconomy and simplicity which marked Swamiji's tours\nare indeed admirable. Two cars when possible and\na small retinue would serve the purpose. When going\nout for the morning constitutional walks near Maidan\nopposite Victoria Memorial or while going around\nCalcutta and its environs, usually two cars (one of\nShri Karnad Kamlakar and the other was of my\nuncle, Katre Seshgiri Rao) were on Pujya Swamiji's\nduty. I was thrilled when my uncle asked me to join\nhim during the entourage of Pujya Swamiji around\nClacutta-Belur-Dakshineshwar.\n   Pujya Swamiji was respectfully received at Belur\nby Swami Gambhirananda, who offered fruits and a\nbouquet of flowers on behalf of Ramkrishna Mission\nand was shown around Belur and Dakshineshwar.\nAt Dakshneshwar the abode of Ramkrishna\nParamhansa, Pujya Anandashram Swamiji spent\nquite a good time visiting the Kali Temple,\nRadhakrishna Temple and the dwelling place of Sri\nRamkrishna. Pujya Swamiji visited Panchavati, where\nTotapuri had first met Sri Ramkrishna before\ninitiation. The visit to Panchavati had been\nmemorable. A Bengali spiritual aspirant in simple\ndress, long hair and a large vermillion tilak on his\nforehead, came running and fell prostrate and\nclasped the feet of His Holiness and was in no mood\nto get up, with tears flowing out. It was indeed a rare\nsight and a piquant situation. However, Pujya Swamiji\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      10             September 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nextricated Himself from the grip and quietly proceeded\nand seated Himself at the Panchavati Shrine, where\nParamhansa used to spend nights in spiritual\nintoxication, absorbed in deep meditation oblivious\nof time!\n    Pujya Swamiji made a brief visit to Jamshedput\n(Tatanagar), a beautiful modern township of Bihar\n(now Jharkhand). Pujya Swamiji was the privileged\nguest of Sri B. R. Kagal, Chief Town Administrator,\nTISCO. Pujya Swamiji was taken round the different\ndepartments of TISCO and several member of the\nStaff. Sri Katre Shankar Rao and Shri Panje Mukund\nRao, on behalf of the local Bhanaps and Gaud\nSaraswats performed Padapuja of His Holiness and\nreceived His blessings.\n    The laity and disciples had the privilege of several\ninformal short talks and pravachans during the five\nvisits of Pujya Swamiji. It has been noted that be it\nbe a five-minute talk or 2 hours discourse-Pujya\nSwamiji always paused for a moment -- a moment\nwhen He is absorbed and oblivious that one feels\n\"The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth\nkeep silence before Him.' Then His lips move slightly,\nsilently offering a prayer. Finally, with a supreme\ncalm so characteristic of Him, He poured forth His\nmind and heart. And, as He does so, the audience\ngets engulfed by the peace of God which surpasses\nall understanding. Pujya Swamiji many a time dwelt\non the significance of the GAYATRI MANTRA JAPA\nand the need of performing the same regularly.

This, in other words, means that man himself\nis the cause of his own happiness and sorrow. The\nLord  has  used  these  two  expressions:  friend  and\nenemy. How do these two words fit in? Our ancients\nhave asked us to realise happiness through Self-\nrealization and by dedicating ourselves to Him. No\nman would, on his own, like to go on a path alone.\nThat  is  why,  our  ancients  set  up  Maths  and\nAshrams so that all may go on the Godward path\ntogether.\n    Attaining one's true Self is the goal of life for\neveryone. Human birth and life is a precious gift\nfrom the Lord who has endowed us with the faculties\nto think for ourselves. It has been given to each and\nevery one of us to seek out and attain for himself\ntrue happiness, the inner happiness (Atma Sukha).\nInstead of doing this, if each man were to lose the\nopportunity and pursue wasteful practices, it may\ntake many million births before he regains human\nbirth again. So, he must make the best of this God-\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                   September  202413\n------- PAGE END -------\ngiven opportunity. He should learn to discriminate\nbetween what is true happiness and what is false,\nbetween what is right and what is wrong. He should\nrealise the importance of this human life of his and\nresolve to make the best possible use of iL. He has\nto realise that his destiny lies in attaining Immortality\n(Amritatva). If he attains immortality, he liberates\nhimself from the cycle of births and deaths.\n    The human birth, in fact, is the culmination of\nthe Tree of Creation, the final product of thousands\nof roots, millions of fruits. Everyone has in him the\nseed of desire. It is this seed that brings him back\ninto the world again and again Just as a seedling\n(Ankur), if properly fried, does not sprout again, so\nalso you should fry the seed of desire and\nindividuality in God-remembrance (Bhagavat\nSmarana) until it stops sprouting again. For this,\nyou should turn your mind inward and seek your\nhappiness in your Self, knowing once and for all\nthat real happiness is not an external object to be\npursued outside but is to be found inside within\nyourself. You should firmly resolve that you will\nattain Atma Jnana or Self-knowledge and enjoy\neverlasting bliss.\n    Yoga and Jnana are the two Sadhanas prescribed\nby our teachers. Yoga means to turn the mind that\nis going outside inward and to sublimate it by\ncommunion with God. Yoga is the rope by which the\nwayward mind is brought under control. Jnana is\nawareness of one's true Self. When you sleep, your\nmind is dead, but that state should not be confused\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        14             September 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nwith Atma Swarup. For on waking up from sleep,\nman regains his sense of possession and becomes\nprey once again to all the sins of old. On the other\nhand, if through Dhyana (meditation) he attains\nJnana (Knowledge), he attains his true Self (Atma\nSwarup) and liberates himself from the cycle of births\nand deaths.\n   We should not allow ourselves to be swept over\nby passing calamities or troubles. We should learn\nto cultivate patience and the powers of endurance,\nknowing full well that we are going through only\nwhat is our lot on account of our Karma. A man who\ndevelops this attitude to life has no enemies. He is\nfriend of all, he sees his God in everyone. He who\nthinks of Him with all devotion, thinking of no other,\nis the true Sadhu. Sadhu is also he who loves to\nchant the names of the Lord and is all the time\nhankering to hear the names of the Lord.\n   When a man has got his mind fixed on his true\nSelf and is firmly on the Godward path, the ups and\ndowns of life do not affect him. Every one of us can\nattain our true Self, which is our goal in life, if we\nsurrender ourselves heart, body and soul to Him\nand thereby attain eternal happiness. So, our prayers\nat His Feet should be to take us in hand and give\nus the strength and patience to pursue His path, to\nattain Him.

May Bhagawati be pleased. That\nSadhaka worships Bhagawati to propitiate Her, to\nglorify  Her  and  the  result  -  he  gets  is,  Oneness\nwith Shiva! How? Because Shiva is Her Own Real\nNature, Her swarupa. Then, there is no difference\nbetween Devi and Shiva. So, an indication is being\ngiven there - to merge into Shiva-swarupa, to merge\ninto  the  Atma-swarupa.  So,  until  the  Jiva-bhava\nremains, She gives Shiva-bhakti, brings a lustre in\nspeech, bestows divine qualities so that the sadhaka\nstarts experiencing Her at an even more miraculous\nlevel.

With this\nobjective, In this way, by chanting stotras, the one\nwho chants ... but how is the chanting to be done?\nIt must be done with intense devotion and this\ngradually leads to meaningful contemplation. Only\nthen, joyfully, She bestows divine qualities such as\ngives purity and proficiency in speech but in reality,\nhis devotion to Shiva is intensified, so that he can\nmerge into his own Oneness.\n                      - Shankarlok Ahmedabad 2023\n          Smarana - A constant practice\n   We can meditate on the Shakti in various forms\nand at various levels. Otherwise, there is a\npossibility of negligence       (GHes#ee). If one were to\nneglect, it is bound to escape one's memory\n(vismarana). Which means, vismarana becomes the\ncause for one's ruin. If there is vismarana of what\nis eternal, then the Jiva tries to hold onto whatever\nis transient in endeavor to feel safe. What happens\nthen? He drowns in the endless cycles of birth and\ndeath! Even in the one body, many deaths can be\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       17             September 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nexperienced. That can happen. We do not want\nthis. That is why vismarana should be avoided. That\nis why smarana is emphasized upon. How do you\nensure smarana? The act of calling upon the Lord\nis to be performed in a certain way - sitting and\ndoing japa. During that time, we do not need the\ngross objects of the world perceived by sound,\ntouch, form, taste, smell. I go inwards. Once I start\nto withdraw, I regulate the organs of perception and\naction. Whatever I have resolved,\n   I will visualize. I give the mind something to\nthink about - to visualize. And then, the mind gets\nengrossed in it. Then what does the intellect do?\nAt this time, buddhi starts the japa. This method\nis known to you. We reiterate this every time.

He becomes a sadhaka - an\naspirant - when he serves the Guru, receives\nguidance, does the upasana, does japa of the\nmantra given to him and puts in effort; thereby\ngaining some success, some experience. Sadhaka,\nwhen he realizes his ambitions etc., spiritual or\nmundane - are equally futile, because he is unsure\nof how to proceed, he seeks refuge. He then\nbecomes a shishya - a disciple. A sadhaka is one\nwho is determined, who is 'doing.' The goal is not\nvery clearly defined. He is a sadhaka. He is doing\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      18             September 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe sadhana. When he understands the futility of\ntrying to fuel his every action with inspiration he\nhas once received; he realizes - ' I require constant\nguidance, I require that inspiration, the necessary\nassociated protection - that is when he becomes a\nshishya.\n              - 2017 Mt Abu / 2019- Sant Sarovar\n  Importance of Antaral time for anusmarana\n                 and internal progress\n   We experience the Guru Sannidhi. Then for a\nfew days, an interval is required - you have to mull\nover it. If you go on receiving, you won't be able\nto digest. To digest it, to assimilate it, it takes time.\nIt is all about maturity. This is not construction.\nTo gain this maturity, you need something like an\ninterval. There is a need to distance yourself. The\nconnection continues. It does not get severed. The\nshishya requires the distancing to do anusmara?a.\nNot just follow the Adesha - not just that. The effort\nto remember and then assimilate in our lives.

He who studies, is a sadhaka.\nCall him a student. There are Samvit sadhaka-s\ngathered here. We have received something, and we\ntake that to augment our spiritual effort. Who then\nis a shishya? A shishya brings his Guru to mind\nevery single moment, and abides by Him. He does\nnot say, \"I have understood. Now don't disturb me.\nI am doing things my way.\" That is why it is very\ndifficult to inculcate disciple-ship. Sadhaka-s are\ngood people. They come, do seva sometimes, and\nare involved in some spiritual effort as has been\ntold to them. But should they be offered even a\nlittle correction, then they cannot tolerate it. This\nshishya is very eager to make headway on the\nspiritual path. He says, 'I do not understand this.\nI may think I am correct, but I am open to\ncorrection from the Guru'. Very very important\npoint. He who is able to endure this, who can\nclamp his ego down saying', You are a fool. Sit\nquietly now. I want to listen to what is beneficial\nto me'- whose goal is this, is a shishya. He\nprogresses continually. A sadhaka progresses only\nto a certain level. He used to do his japa for 15\nminutes, now he does it for half an hour. And\nwhen he speaks of it to others, he says, ' I can\nsit  for japa  for an hour!' The ego rears its head,\nand becomes stronger. The shishya does not allow\nthis to happen. He doesn't, he is not interested in\nhis achievements. He craves for the insights the\nGurushakti can give.\n                                         - Jodhpur 2019\n                (Transcribed by Shrikala Kodikal)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20            September 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Shri\nKrishna vows in all sincerity that those who are His\nsincere devotees shall attain Godhead themselves.\nThat is the one great secret of genuine happiness.\nWe know instances of persons who are unhappy even\nthough endowed with all the world's goods in abundant\nmeasure. All material happiness has to depend on\nexternals for its very existence and continuance, and\nis therefore uncertain and unreal. Such happiness is\nnot unmixed but is generally found to be tainted with\nsorrow in varying proportions. \"Merge thy mind in Me\",\nsays the Lord.

It is not easy for every one\nto worship an impersonal God in the abstract. An idea\nbecomes easier of mental comprehension if there is a\nconcrete symbol embodying it. That is why, even in the\nfield of nationalism and patriotism, ideas are sought\nto be given concrete representation-moorta swarup-by\nsuitable symbols like the national flag.\nSimilarly, in spiritual matters also, placing an image\nof God before ourselves, we find it easier to engage in\ndevotion by worshipping that image and prostrating\nourselves before it. It was therefore that our forefathers\nintroduced the system of temples wherein to worship\nGod. They help to strengthen devotion. The Paramatman\nis omnipresent, so that, strictly speaking, He is present\nnot only in temples but everywhere else. To discipline\nthe mass mind, however, institutions like temples are\nnecessary. Where an image is installed according to\nthe prescribed ritual and worshipped in all solemnity\nas laid down in the ancient Scriptures, the presence\nof Divinity naturally makes itself felt to a greater\nextent than elsewhere. Therein lies the secret of the\nvalue of temples to mankind.\nThis Shrimat Ananteshwar temple at Vittal is one\nof biggest and oldest of the temples belonging to our\nCommunity-perhaps the oldest of all our temples. A\ndraft scheme has recently been notified for the temple\nby the Board for Hindu Religious Endowments in this\nProvince, and such a scheme will probably be framed\nO DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\nLet my Pranams be in my Deeds.\nTo offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n- Smt.

But whoever\nbe trustees, co-operation of the public, and especially\nof the local public, is absolutely necessary for the\nsuccessful management of the temple.\nThe future of the Board seems itself to be somewhat\nuncertain, as the Congress Party, which is in office\nnow, appears to be thinking of other ways and means\nfor ensuring efficiency in temple management. But\nwhichever Government or party may be in power,\nwhether the Board itself continues or ceases to exist,\ntemples will remain and will have to be managed and\nmanaged well.\nThe work of temples is almost literally, as well as\nreally, the work of God. It must therefore go on\nunhampered, and no party spirit should rear its head\nin that kind of work. In saying so, we do not mean to\nconvey that party spirit has manifested itself to any\nundesirable extent here and that any defects have\nbeen noticed in the work of this temple as a result\nthereof. Our intention is only to sound a suitable note\nof precaution as regards the future.\nNo one can please all. Whatever a man may do, he\ncannot expect to please everybody. Every one should\ntherefore try to see that the right thing is done and\nnot merely that the thing done is pleasing to himself.\nBy doing so, the necessary atmosphere of sympathy\nand co-operation will be created, and when people co-\noperate, real benefit will accrue as a result of the\nservice extended by them to the temple.\nWe pray to God to endow all with the right sense\nof duty and service necessary for the purpose and to\nbless them with peace and happiness.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

The\nscriptures speak of  \" Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma \" .\nWhat is that Brahman? It is the Eternal, Nameless,\nFormless Truth. We cannot describe it nor can you\nunderstand it with the help of your five senses. It is an\nexperience which each one has to undergo for himself\nto realise what it is. It could be called Supreme\nConsciousness-because, it is a Consciousness that\npervades us within and without and when you attain\nthat Brahman, you shed the body idea and the\nConsciousness within you becomes one with the\nConsciousness without. Man, by birth and nature, is\nattuned to name and form, but to attain Brahman, he\nhas to get above these senses. To attain such a Brahman,\none may have to spend any number of lives doing\nsadhana. To realise that the all-pervading universal Spirit\nis in all objects and creatures as in oneself, any number\nof lives are worth spending.\nHow can we attain the Brahman?  We have to repose\nfull trust in Paramatman and trust Him to do the best\nfor us. When our trust becomes unshakeable, He\nvouchsafes us all the spiritual experiences necessary to\ngo ahead. Let us pray with all our heart to Datta Guru\nto guide us and lead us and He will not let us down. All\nthat is needed is total surrender. And, once man has\nattained the Brahman, he is no longer affected by the\npast, present or future. He has no regrests over the\npast, no tension over the present and no worries for the\nfuture. He becomes a witness to the passing phenomenon\nof life, without being an actual participant in it or being\naffected by what he sees. There are many spiritual paths\nprescribed by our ancients to help man achieve his goal\nin lfie. He has to choose the path for which he has the\ngreat aptitude. He should not blindly follow a particular\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202211\npath because some body else has followed it or because\nsomebody advises him to. He should adopt his own path\nout of a strong inner sense of conviction and, having\ndetermined so, he should direct all his efforts to\nprogressing on the same. If he really wants to be free\nfrom the cycle of birth and death, he should resolve to\nput in any effort, any sacrifice that is necessary to go\nahead.\nThe scriptures speak of Ahimsa etc as means of\nSadhana. Ahimsa does not mean merely non-killing,but\nabstention from even committing ' violence ' in thought\nor speech. Because, to think ill of another or to speak ill\nof another also amounts to Himsa or violence. Why  is\nman asked to observe total Ahimsa-of thought, word and\ndeed?  Because, he may attain mental peace and\ncontentment.  Namasmaran or God-remembrance by\nuttering His Name is another means of Sadhana.  In the\npath of Bhakti, we are asked to consider ourselves as\nmere play-things in the hands of the Divine Power and\nto give ourselves completely up to Him.  That is the path\nof surrender.  Pranayama is another path that helps\nman to achieve concentration of his mind on his real\nSelf, the Brahman..In Pranayama, you strive to achieve\ncontrol over the senses and the mind.  It is not a path\nfor everyone as it calls for strong powers of concentration\nand breath control.  By and large, man's mind runs easily\nto external sense-objects and this makes concentration\ndifficult.  That is why the scriptures prescribe the path\nof surrender for most people.  One means of achieving\nsurrender is to  do the Japa, but Japa should be done\nwith faith.  When you are doing the Japa, you should\nfirmly believe that it is all-powerful and will lead you to\nGod.  Unless a man has a definite goal in life, he will\ndrift from one life to another without making any progress\nand suffering from the ups and downs of life.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202212\nIt is said that if a devotee pursues the path of Bhakti\nor Devotion, he can attain Jnana or Knowledge also.\nBhakti teaches us that the God we worship is not a\ndistant Being seated in heaven, but is close to us, in\nour own hearts, guiding us every moment of our life.\nSant Namdev, Tukaram etc., in their compositions exhort\nus to turn to that Supreme Being, offer Him our all and\nmake Him ours.  The same God is seated in the hearts\nof all beings and creatures.  How long will man continue\nto struggle, afflicted by the ills of the world?  He should\nresolve for himself once and for all to realise his true\nSelf and Paramatman will bless his efforts with success.\nThe Datta Jayanti celebrations, now going on, offer\nan opportunity to all the religious-minded to take part\nand offer their prayers to the Lord.  We offer at the Feet\nof Datta Guru all the prayers and aspirations of the\ndevotees gathered here and pray to Him to crown them\nwith success.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

(As summarised in\nThe Vision, April 2019 issue)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202214\n* Karma Kanda has rituals, Pujas etc. Most of what is\nKarma Kanda is not being observed any more. We\nhave to do Karma Kanda because we have Kartritva\n(doership) and Bhoktritva (enjoyership). Karma is\ndefined by these two factors.\n* Upasana is sitting in the presence of God. It is not\na temporary or fleeting acquaintance with God, it is\nthe determination to understand our relationship\nwith Him more clearly, because it becomes clear to\nthe aspirant that 'Aham' and 'Mama' - 'I' and 'mine'\n- do not really help. This is called Vairagya.\n* As Vairagya develops through intelligent thinking,\nthe aspirant also develops Vishesha Raga - Bhakti -\nlove for the Divine. This comes through the Punya\nof the past Janmas and Satsang. Therefore, Satsang\nis extremely important.\n* Upasana is the process of acquiring the Anugraha\nof the Lord through our prayers etc. and realising\nthat the Divine is most important in our lives and\nthat God is not a means to get other things in life.\n* When this understanding and maturity comes, the\nway we approach God also will be different. This\ncomes after a lot of Tapas and Satsang.\n* Every human being has the ability to transform the\nmechanical Karma into Upasana. Negligence can\ncause the Upasana to degenerate into Karma\nbecause Upasana is designed for Jnana. So, a fair\namount of introspection is required. In introspection\nwe need to know that 'yes, there are lacunae, there\nare something wrong in us, but this is not us. We\ndon't want them, therefore. O Lord, please remove\nthem.' That is the connection with Divine. Eventually\neverything we do will become Upasana, it will have\nthe touch of the Divine. We will be able to be in\ncontact with the Divine in the most mundane\nactivities also.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202215\n* Upasana becomes meaningful when it is oriented\ntowards the spiritual - Jnana. In everything that we\nshould get the bliss of having done it as Upasana\nwith the right Bhavana. Then when we sit and do\nRam Nam we should be able to do it even mentally.\n4) For dealing with the mind, we have to draw strength\nand inspiration from the Divine.\n5) If we are asked to keep quiet and contemplate on \"who\nam I\", the mind will get baffled. It is only accustomed\nto thinking of itself by way of its accomplishments,\nfailure or relationships. So, we take a pause and say, \"I\nrefuse to understand myself by way of my\naccomplishments, failures or my relationships, I want\nto understand myself with reference to my connection\nwith You - God.\" This should strengthen our relationship\nwith God. Strengthening this connection, this\nidentification, is very very important. Then whatever we\ndo becomes Upasana.\n(Courtesy: The Vision, April 2019)\nJANUARY 2023","type":"Document"}

He makes\nsphoorti also melt into Ananda, bliss. That very same\nworld is now an ocean of bliss. Bliss came to you as\ntouches of fulfilment before also; but you did not\nrecognise them and so many moments of fulfilment\npassed by while you were busy with the successes of\nyour worldly life. Then when you awakened to an idea\nof  true joy and peace it was very vague and faint, like\nthe presence of a blooming tree unseen but felt\nthrough the fragrance that comes floating from afar.\nIt only makes your heart ache.\nGo to the Root\nSimilarly, in the great agony of salvation of your\nsoul, you contact that tree of bliss. But how will you\nidentify it? Flowers may bloom once a year. Better to\nrecognise a tree through the foliage. But suppose you\ncome to the tree in the fall? Better learn to recognise\nthe bark of the tree. Suppose it is stripped by indecent\nhands felled by the greedy axe? Better then to discover\nthe root and identify the tree through the taste, touch,\nshape and fragrance of the root.\nTherefore, the Upanishad, discoursing on bliss,\nsays: \"Go to the root of the deepest layer of your self,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202220\nthe base of the the Anandamaya Kosha. You will find\nthere the essence of bliss rooted in the nature of\nBrahman \"Ananda Atma, Brahma pucchham\npratishtha.\" That  root you must take hold of and taste.\nThis is what is meant by sphoorti melting into Ananda.\nIt is the Guru who initiates this worship and thus\nmakes the relationship of soul and God sanctified and\nmeaningful. After this, the world becomes one stretch\nof dedication and faithful following of God's\nintimations till, finally, the unknown truth of God and\nknown untruth of life merge to yield the known form\nof truth. This is Dakshinamurti.\nActually, he is neither formed nor known but\nappears so in the experiential field. Therefore he is\ncompared to the sky, vyomavat vyaptadehaya. How\nthis appears as the form of known truth is inexplicable.\nThe Guru himself is not really the cause of this\nperception, because, after this perception has arisen,\nhe also melts into the sky of consciousness. That sky\nof Dakshinamurti remains and He alone is the Guru.\nThe guide becomes the goal just as the path maker\nbecame path; and, of course, the pilgrim was himself\nthe path all the while.\nTherefore, in samvit sadhana , though certain\ndetails of spiritual progress are outlined, the main\nstress is on the intensity of feeling and sincerity of\npractice.

Some read into the\nGita an emphatic call to renounce all action in the\nworld as the ultimate goal. Some others argue that\nthe Gita holds devotion to a personal God as the\nessential creed of it. Some would have it that the\nGita urges the soul to plunge into action, making\nthat alone the sole criterion and the one necessary\ncondition of human existence. Again some others,\ntaking the Mahabharata war including the Gita as\nonly an allegorical exposition of the eternal truths,\ninterpret the teachings from their viewpoint as\nembodying an uncompromising cult of Ahimsa. Each\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202222\none of these expounders of the Gita is right from the\nangle of vision by which he has struggled to\nunderstand the scripture. But the whole truth\nenshrined in its eighteen chapters is all that they\nhave said put together and much more besides. For\nan all-round authoritative, conclusive and\ncomprehensive treatise on the Gita, among the\ncommentaries of the present day, one has to turn to\nthe illuminating and inspiring volumes of \"The Essays\non the Gita\" by Sri Aurobindo.\nTo understand life and realise its glory integrally,\none has to study the Gita in all its phases and from\nall standpoints. To have a partial view of a particular\naspect of it alone, and to hold forth that as the\nwhole truth, has been the cause of imperfection in\nspiritual experience.\nThe purpose of the Gita is to proclaim that human\nlife is essentially Divine-spiritually, mentally and\nphysicatty. Its one aim is to prove that spirit and\nmatter are one and the same, Activity in the world,\nwhatever form it might take, as circumstances and\nconditions demand, is not a thing to be shunned or\nrenounced. What is needed is to divinise Life through\nthe attainment of freedom from the individuat sense\nby the emergence of it into God, who is at once the\nsoul, the universe and the all-transcendent and all-\ninclusive Truth.\nThe soul whose life is thus liberated, the Gita\nsays, is utterly Divine in all his movements --\nsignificant as well as insignificant. Now action for\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202223\nhim is but a natural and spontaneous flow of Divine\nenergy acting through him. As God's supreme will\ndetermines, this energy works through him equally\nto create, to preserve and to destroy. Since this\nillumined personality intuitively bases his actions\non the vision of the universal Reality and performs\nthem in a state entirely bereft of the individual\nsense, they do not affect him for good or evil. So\nlong as the soul misses this acme o attainment, he\nflounders in the morass of conflicting dualities --\ngood and evil, virtue and sin, Ahimsa and Hinsa and\npleasure and pain.\nThe Divine Shakti works in the universe both for\nconstructive and destructive purposes. Only when\nthe  Supreme Power acts in man, through his lower\nnature, it is vitiated with greed, lust and selfishness.\nIn this state, in whatever manner he acts, his works\nare tainted. For personal aggrandisement, such as\nfor  wealth, power and glory, he would launch into\nany kind of action irrespective of its nature as Ahimsa\nor  Himsa. Whereas the same Shakti when She acts\nin a man, freed entirely from every egoistic impulse\nor ambition, does so for the uplift and protection of\nthe oppressed and innocent humanity. Here Shakti\nmay  work through the purified medium or vehicle,\ncreatively or destructively. Creation and destruction\nare concomitant movements. We can never separate\nthem. Every new creation has at its basis the\ndestruction of the old. This is the law of Nature\nuniversally applicable. We cannot palliate, shirk or\nignore this law of God controlling all the activities of\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam December 202224\nNature, including those of human beings. It is ever\nthere, facing us at every turn. The saving grace for\nman, in the field of action, lies only in his acting as\nan instrument of the Divine -- in a state of utter\nfreedom from the touch and recoil of action. Here,\nwhat is essential is complete dedication of life's\nactions to the will and power of the Almighty, dwelling\nin the hearts of all beings, creatures and things.\nElse, if we move only in the vicious circle of harassing\nDwandwas -- good and evil -- and attempt to cling\nto one of them for attainment of true freedom and\npeace, we can never reach the goal. Doubts and\nfears will ever rise in the mind of such a man, and\nhe will become a scared creature, always a prey to\nimpatience, suspicion and despair. Therefore, the\ncommand of Sri Krishna is: \"Rise beyond the dualities,\nrise beyond the Dharmas of the Gunas, i.e. rise\nbeyond all conditioned states of existence, conceived\nof and set up as standards by the fettered mind and\nintellect, and be one with Me -- the all-transcendent\nReality -- and then act in life as My instrument, as\nMy Vibhuti -- Myself revealed in and as your form\nand body. This is the deliverance that I offer you;\nthis is the supreme blessedness in which I grant\nyou the bliss of immortality.\"\nSpontaneity of life born of an egoless purity and\ninnocence, and a consciousness of immortal freedom\nand a condition of perfect Divine ecstasy and peace\nis the one supreme note and refrain of the Voice\nthat rings though the Gita.\n(Courtesy: The Vision)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

With faith firmly implanted in\ntheir hearts by intense meditation and personal experience,\nRishis have thought about the origin of the Vedas according\nto their own method. A detailed exposition of the shastric\nmanner of discussion will only bore those who do not\nunderstand it. Hence the subject will be briefly dealt with.\nThe word Veda comes from the root \"Vid\" meaning\nknowledge. As the Vedas impart uncommon knowledge which\nis not capable of sense-perception or proof, the name is\nsignificant.\nThe Vedas are also known as Shrutis. Shruti means what\nis heard: knowledge acquired by hearing from the mouth of\nthe Guru and so passed on from generation to generation-\nonly heard and not composed or created. Mimamsakas argue\nfrom this that the Vedas have been in existence without a\nbeginning.\nThe discoveries which modern scientists say they have\nmade, may be found embedded in the Vedas at least in\nembryo. Inasmuch as such an extraordinary storehouse of\nknowledge could not possibly have been created by mere man,\nShri Shankaracharya declares in his Bhashya  that the\nomniscient Ishvara alone must have created it (Brahmasutra.\n1-1-3), On the other hand, with their extreme zeal for the\nO DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\nLet my Pranams be in my Deeds.\nTo offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n- Smt. Uma & Shri Arun S. Bolangdy.\nTHE VEDAS ARE NOT\nTHE WORK OF MAN\n(Delivered at Karkala in May 1937,\nand published in Kanara Saraswat\nin July 1937.)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 20237\nauthority of the Vedas, Mimamsakas hold that Ishvara could\nnot have been free to create the Vedas and that they are eternal\n(Jaiminisutra, 1-1-23)-an opinion held by the Sankhya school\nas well. The Vedas describe themselves as the breath of\nIshvara; seeing that breathing is an effortless process, they\nmust have emanated from Ishvara without any effort on His\npart; the knowledge of the Vedas which existed in the previous\nKalpa, came to Ishvara after the Deluge; hence the Vedas are\neternal and not a new creation : so argue the Seshvara\nMimamsakas. Even the Naiyayikas acknowledge that the\nVedas are the creation of Purushottama or the Supreme Spirit\nand not of ordinary mortals.\nThe fact that branches of the Vedas are described as Kathaka\nand so forth does not disprove this. It is not that Katha and\nother Rishis wrote or created them but that they greatly spread\nthe knowledge of the respective branches (Jaimini, 1-1-30).\nSeveral critics argue that as the Vedas seem to contain\nthe names of certain persons, they could not have been in\nexistence before those persons came into being. It would\nappear, however, that the names in question have different\nmeanings altogether ( Jaimini, 1-1-31). In the same way,\nMaharshi Yaska declares that, if particular hymns are known\nby the names of particular Rishis, it is because the Rishis\nobtained them and realised them through meditation and not\ncreated them.\nOn the whole, scholars have arrived at the conclusion that\nthe knowledge of the Vedas, which was without a beginning,\nemanated from Ishvara, and that it was later made known in\nthe form of sentences by Rishis who had obtained realisation.\nStudents of modern research have tried to determine the\nage of the Vedas in a variery of ways. There are persons who\nhave put it down at anything from 25,000 to 20,000 years.\nSwami Vivekananda and a few others maintain that the Vedas\nhave existed for at least 9,000 years.\nEven when viewed from this standpoint, the greatness of\nthe Vedas does not depend upon whether they are or are not\nthe creation of man. It is acknowledged by all that, so far as is\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 20238\nknown at present, they represent the most ancient body of\nextant literature on earth. That this great literature, so full of\nthe essence of truth, should have become widely known in\nthe old days when moden facilities for the spread of education\nand knowledge were nil and the art of writing was unkown;\nthat regulations should have been made to preserve it\nuntainted through a succession of Rishis etc.; that, by fixing\nthe exact intonation and otherwise, it should have been\ncarefully secured from change and has actually survived to\nthis day-these things alone may well lead one to believe that\nin the Vedas there is a power divine.\nMay you all take pride and have faith in this divine\nliterature, and may you thereby be blessed!","type":"Document"}

You at least have us to\nwhom you can come and tell all your troubles, your problems\nand seek solace. To whom can we ourselves turn but to God\nHimself? So, we tell Him all our problems and, we may tell\nyou, He has never let us down. He has always stood by us.\nSo, also, God always stands by anyone who turns to Him\nand trusts Him. So, do turn to the Lord in your hour of need\nand, rest assured, He will help you attain peace. And, now\nwe will take up questions. Whenever we had any problems\nor questions on religious matters, we used to ask His\nHoliness (Shrimad Anandashram Swamiji) and Swamiji used\nto solve all our doubts. Then, we had been to Kashi for what\nyou may call as \"higher studies.\" We were only sorry all\nthis while that there was none in our community\nforthcoming with questions on religious matters that we\nwould love to answer. In Bombay, no doubt, we were asked\nsome questions but they were not as deep as the ones being\nasked here. That is why, we are really happy with the\nquestions you have posed today and we will answer them\nas best as the Lord makes us to.\nQuestion : What is the difference between Shrutis and\nSmritis?\nH. H. : Shrutis are what our sages have spoken advising\nus of the spiritual path while Smritis are for our daily way\nof life, Smritis teach us how to conduct ourselves.\nQuestion :  Why did Rama have to hide behind seven\ntrees to kill Vali? Was it right for Him to do so?\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\n(Summary of the Ashirvachan delivered by His\nHoliness at Shri Chitrapur Math,\nBengaluru on 8-10-1978)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202310\nH. H. : There are many meanings to this episode.\nSometimes, in the performance of one's duty, whether one\nis an Emperor, a Swami or anybody, he needs to hide not\nbehind seven but even seventy trees! No doubt, when Ravana\nabducted Sita and Rama pursued him to Lanka, He fought\nRavana face to face and killed him. Then, why should Rama\nhave concealed Himself behind some trees to kill Vali? One\ncannot explain away this action easily but, one thing we\nshould remember is that Rama was ever just, He did always\nthe right thing. Because of suspicions voiced by a Dhobi, He\neven abandoned his wife Sita who was then pregnant and\nwho had already been purified by emerging unscathed from\nthe fire on her rescue from Lanka. Rama teaches us that no\nmatter what we are, a King, a Swami or an ordinary person\nwe must always do our duty. Even though it was only a\nwasherman who voiced suspicions about Sita, Rama felt duty-\nbound to pay due heed to him and to ask Sita to undergo\nanother test of her purity and chastity. If He were not a king\nand Emperor, perhaps He would not have abandoned Sita.\nWe all worship Him today because of such acts of his, in\nspite of his doing this. Valmiki Ramayan does not give any\nreasons for various actions that Rama did. Then, how can\nwe give any reasons. We would say that even Brahma may\nnot be able to say why, except that Rama did His duty.\nQuestion :  Detractors and mischief-mongers live in\ncomfort and with plenty while the devout and the pious\nones have to undergo great difficulties. Why is it so?\nH. H. :  That is because those who are humble, God-\nfearing and devout are wanted quickly back by the Lord.\nThose who sin and do nothing but sin may, on the outside,\nappear as though they are living in comfort and doing well.\nBut, really speaking, they enjoy no peace of mind, they\ncannot get sleep at nights whereas those who are devotees\nof the Lord may actually be enjoying the difficulties through\nwhich they pass. Take the example of our own Pandurang\nShastri (at Shirali Math). He laughs, he cries but he may be\nregarded as a real Yogi as he remains unaffected by passing\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202311\nevents of life. That is why we too pray to the Lord that if we\nare born again, we should be born in Shirali and be like\nPandurang. We are reminded of the Hindi couplet which\nruns thus : \"The world calls me mad, I call the world mad;\nbut, O Lord, let me remain forever mad.\" The devotees of\nGod do not consider their privations as difficulties. They\nwelcome it with open arms.\nQuestion : When doing Japa or Dhyana, is it necessary\nto sit on the floor?\nH. H. :  We have always said that to do Japa or Dhyana\n(meditation), you can do it anyway, sitting on your bed, on\nyour cot, on the floor or in any pose. The main thing is that\nyou should be able to achieve concentration of mind. So,\nwe say, you can do your Japa or Dhyana even sitting on a\ncot. What matters is how quickly you can achieve\nconcentration of mind.\nQuestion : Why should there be obstacles and all kinds\nof hurdles in doing good deeds? Why should our own\nchildren oppose us?\nH. H. :  We do not know why one should suffer more\nwhen he is engaged in only doing good to others. One thing\nwe can say from our own experience is that the Lord tests\nus all the time, He wants us to prove ourselves. Sometimes,\nour own children may raise obstructions to our doing good\nbut that should not deter us. In our own case, when we set\nout to do something good, all kinds of obstacles and\ndifficulties come in the way, we even have to hear all sorts\nof things said about us, but we do not mind. Therefore, he\nwho has undertaken to do something good should go ahead\nwith all courage and fortitude, undeterred by whatever\nbefalls him.\nQuestion :  Can anyone render selfless service or is it\nonly saints who can do selfless service?\nH. H. : Usually, the ordinary person strives for himself\nand his own comforts alone. But, he should strive to render\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202312\nselfless service to others as well. As for saints, they are\nsaints because of their selfless lives and their continuous\nservice of the whole humanity in whom they see their Lord.\nA saint never thinks of himself, his own comforts etc. Man,\nby nature, is an egoistic creature, he works only for himself\nand his own good. On the otherhand, if he were to dedicate\nall his acts to God and takes it that he does everything\nby the Grace of God, then automatically he starts rendering\nselfless service . In our case, for example, sitting on this\nPeetha and giving Phalmantrakshat is one kind of service.\nBut, real service is to help those in need, help the homeless\nwith a roof over their heads, help parents of unmarried girls\nfind husbands, help the jobless get jobs and a means of\nlivelihood etc. All such acts of service can be called selfless\nservice. A saint is one who looks upon all creatures, an old\nman, a girl, a woman, the poor, the disabled, nay, everyone,\nwith equal vision. He serves them all equally. Even people\nliving and moving in the world can render selfless service.\nQuestion : Is God the cause of natural calamities like\nearthquakes, famines, cyclones etc? If so, how can He be\ncalled as Ever Compassionate? Then, there are many Yagnas\nperformed to avert disasters. Does God respond to them?\nH. H. : Earthquakes, famines and other natural calamities\nare nothing but the phenomena of our solar system. Krishna\nassures us in the Gita that whenever the forces of evil become\ndominant and truth becomes oppressed, He takes birth from\ntime to time to protect the pious and destroy evil forces. You\nmay see for yourselves that no disaster ususally touches the\nplace where God-realized souls reside. No natural calamity\ncan touch such a spot. God has three aspects, as Brahma He\nis the Creator, as Vishnu He is the Preserver and as Shiva He\nis the Destroyer. Our own Ishta-Devata is Shiva. Shiva does\nas He pleases. It is not proper that we should find fault with\nanything that Shiva does. Everything happens by His will.\nEven here, there can be an earthquake tomorrow--and we\ncan only submit to His will. As for the second question whether\nGod will respond to the yagnas, the answer would be that we\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202313\nmust trust God. Whether we can develop such a faith and\ntrust in Him through Yagnas depends on how sincere are\nour prayers. We should pray to Him with all our heart, with\nsingle-minded devotion. Krishna assures us in the Gita that\nhe who prays with single-minded devotion can face any\namount of troubles or calamities with equanimity. Man must\nonly first be brave in his mind but in order to get that kind\nof mental fortitude, we must cease regarding our mind as\nours but dedicate it at the feet of the Lord. It is said truly, to\nattain Shiva you have to become Shiva yourself. Therefore,\npray to Him in all humility and sincerity. It does not matter\nin what form you worship Him but He will surely respond to\nyour prayers.\nQuestion : God is known as the world's Sutradhari.\nThen, where is there room for Viveka?\nH. H. : He is the Sutradhari not merely of our world but\nof all creation--of plants, animals and everything in the\nuniverse. We must first learn to accept this truth. Then, we\nwill have no difficulty in pursuing our Dharma. If everyone\nwere to listen to his own heart, he will be performing his\nDharma. For doing the right Dharma, we must first instal\nGod in our heart and keep Him firmly enthroned therein.\nThen, you will become a true devotee, a Sadhaka and will\ngo forward. Keep God in any form you like in your heart.\nThen, there is the question, if we take everything as\nhappening by God's will, can we give up our Vivek Buddhi\nand sit still? This question is not properly worded. Viveka\nBuddhi comes to us by God's Grace . What is the sense,\ntherefore in abandoning it and sitting still? We must use\nour God-given intelligence to turn ourselves to Him who\nmade us. Then, we will truly realise that everything happens\nby His will alone.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Both acts are profusely spiced with mystic\nintuitions. Through intuitions, what appears as insoluble\nquestions of philosophy can be understood in an incredibly\neasy way.\nA flower can convey to you what the most scholarly\nacademician cannot. If we cannot learn from this, you\ncannot learn from anything else. That is the Samvit way.\nLife alone can teach you. The formless has taken form in\nthis. This universe is the flower of God. To God it is just like\nthis tiny flower. But we need the Samvit Master to show it to\nus and enlighten us through an intuition.\nThe two concepts of time and nature are insufficient to\nreveal  the ultimate cause of the universe. In the Gita, when\nthe vision of time was given to Arjuna, the Lord makes it\nclear that this was not the ultimate. The Lord asks Arjuna\nto \"enter into\" the vision. It is the Deva of Shvetashvatara\nwhich the Gita names as Purushottama. This connection is\nbrought out very clearly in the sixth chapter's sixth mantra\nwhere the Upanishad states: \"Beyond the form of the tree of\nlife and of time, stands the Supreme by which  this Universe\nis set in motion.\"\n3esveeJe=leb efvel3eefceob efn meJeY=\n%ee keAe}keAe}es iegCeer meJe&efJeDee ~\nlesvesefueleb keAce& efJeJele&lescn\nHe=LJ3eeHelespeescefve}Keeefve ef(r)evl3eced ~\nAbove second mantra explains it: \"Every moment, and\neternally, all things are covered and permeated by this\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202322\nselfconscious, all-knowing presence, which is timer of the\ntime, and the nurturer of nature.

This process is done through the\nAshtamurti Upasana, explained in the agamas.\nThe Durga Saptashati says: \"Mahamaya, the Deva-shakti,\ndrags down even the minds of the great Jnanis into the\nabysmal pit of delusion.\" Sureshvaracharya points out in\nhis Manasollasa that this can be overcome \"by Ishvara\nUpasana , for which the Ashtamurti Upasana  is most\nuniversally, easily and effectively available to all.\"\nThis is the most natural and most desirable approach to\nIshvara Upasana. It helps us develop a worshipful attitude to\nour environment.\nIn any Upasana, we insist on two things, the elevation\nand expansion of awareness. The rootcause of our problems\nin spiritual or mundane life is a narrow mentality. One has\nto feel an expansion within and without; first, without.\nWe are told that Leo Tolstoy, tortured by the\nmeaninglessness of life, could not be convinced of the\nexistence of God and contemplated suicide. He walked into\nthe woods and cast one last look around. Suddenly he found\nGod everywhere. Life itself was the proof of immaculate power\nand glory--Devasyaisha Mahima. A sudden faith revived and\nhe was saved.\nThe Elements\nThat is what Ashamurti does to you. Wherever you are,\nwhatever you see, every bit of creation has come out of\nthese principles.

These\nare the internal ashtamurtis. These are the soul beams--\nsights, sound, smell, touch, mental functions, intellectual\nfunctions and the ego. The Bhagavad Gita calls them Ashta\nprakriti. This is the internal Ashta which we are always\ncarrying, and we call their play 'life'.\nThis is a fine illustrationn of the mantra's instruction:\nHow to tackle the world as God's mahima and be a medium\nfor His acts and for His glory. In Samvit sadhana, senses are\nthe Savmit deities ( Devas). When we handle them as such,\nthey will lead us to the Deva-deva, the Atman. If you can feel\nin this way, then alone will it become Ashtamurti Upasana.\nThis form ofIshvara upasana will take you beyondMahamaya.\nNow let us see how the world-experience can be transformed\nby the purified senses, mind, intellect and ego, so that we\ncan go beyond the senses. This takes us directly into Karma\nYoga and Jnana Yoga mentioned in the third mantra.\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt. Abu)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Hence\nceremonies are the means of attaining Brahmanhood\nwhich is known as the second birth.\n\"Ceremonies wash away the sins which arise at\nbirth,\" says Manu. Shankaracharya maintains in the\nPrapanchasara that there is uncommon power in\nmantras. According to Kumarilabhatta, \"Every Vedic\nrite has its unseen utility (even where it has utility\nwhich can be perceived).\" Hence how can one say that\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI ANANDASHRAM\n(Delivered in the course of northern tour of\n1937-38, and published in\nKanara Saraswat in July 1938).\nCEREMONIES AND EXPENSE\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 20226\nceremonies performed with uncommonly powerful\nVedic incantations are of no use?\nOf such ceremonies, only two, namely, the thread\nceremony and marriage are generally performed in\nour Community at present; and even as regards these,\nthere was recently a demand, in view of the large\nexpenditure involved, that the Math should fix the\ncharges payable to priests in order that economies\nmight be effected. We accepted this view to some\nextent, classified the different portions of ceremonials\nas obligatory under the Shastra and discretionary\nunder custom, and indicated the opinion that those\nwho wished to reduce expense need confine\nthemselves only to the obligatory portions. At the Math\nitself, it has been arranged that a thread ceremony\nmay be performed even for ten rupees exclusive of\nbhuridakshina and santarpana, the rate of the former\nbeing discretionary and the latter costing 4  1/2 annas\nper head. But if priests elsewhere are directed to\ncharge accordingly, the poor ones who have to depend\nupon their profession for their living, may have to\nabandon the calling altogether, and, it will be\nimpossible to fulfil the desire of the Community to\nhave properly educated priests.\nAgain, a question has been raised whether the fact\nthat priests belonging to other Communities perform\nthe Satyanarayana vrata more cheaply than our\npriests, is due to any difference between our\nAshvalayana method and the method adopted by the\nformer. In the first place, Ashvalayana has not\nprescribed this vrata at all.

It\ncontains Sage Vashista's advice to Rama as to how one should\nlive in this world. Rama was a Divine avatar and yet he\nunderwent many hardships. His childhood was happy, but from\nthe time  of his scheduled coronation, he had to go to forest, he\nlost his wife Sita etc. Finally, he gave up his body in the river\nSharayu. This does not mean that Rama committed suicide\nbecause, he was given a lot of instruction in Brahma Vidya by\nVashishta; he had knowledge of the Self. We propose to take up\nfour or five verses, from his instructions.\nWhat we call, \" Atma-tatwa\" in the Upanishads, if we want to\ntruly understand it, the mind that we now have must be\n'destroyed'. For this, both Yoga and Knowledge are necessary. Yoga\nhere means control of the mind and Knowledge means to see all\nin One, which is indeed difficult. The Upanishads say that the\nworld is apparent (Mithya) but this is difficult to understand\nbecause we consider this body, the sense organs, the organs of\naction, mind, intellect, ego etc. as 'I'. We have to make effort to\ngain this understanding by Yoga and Knowledge.\nAtma cannot be gained by mere listening nor by intellect\nalone. By forgetting all our surroundings and making the enquiry.\n\"Who am I?\", by rejecting the body, sense organs, mind, intellect,\nego etc, we must go beyond and discover consciousness.\nVashishta tells Rama that this Self-knowledge is given to a\ngood disciple who has developed dispassion.\nNot everyone can put in efforts that are necessary to gain\nSelf-knowledge. It is imperative that the disciple has the definite\nconclusion that \"I am bound, life is sorrowful, my mind runs after\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\nSHRADDHA\n(Summary of an Ashirvachan in Hindi at\nThunder Bay, Canada, on Wednesday,\nJuly 18, 1979)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 20229\nwealth but wealth does not give me fullness. Therefore, I want\nliberation.\" We say these things to you in order to impress on\nyou the need of reading these verses daily because, they advise\nus as to how to live in this world.\nTo get a Guru is difficult and even if one succeeds in meeting\na Guru, this knowledge will not take place without God's Grace. It\nis said in Vivekachudamani : namely, that three things are\ndifficult and are possible only by God's Grace and they are: (i) human\nbirth, in which alone one can get a suitable mind and intellect\nequipped for liberation; (ii) desire for liberation, without which\nmost people eat, drink and die to be born again; and (iii) company\nof the Mahatmas, Vashishta explains how the disciple must live,\nhow the Guru will instruct, how to go ahead in this pursuit etc. He\nsays to Rama: \"You will have to rule and face life's many problems.\nYou will be beset with lots of difficulties, you will face many enemies\nand you will wonder why, even after leading such a righteous life\nwith meditation (Dhyana), devotion (Bhakti) and in spite of being\nan incarnation, you get all these difficulties.\"\nBoth happiness and sorrow are unreal. When the mind rises,\nhappiness or sorrow rises along with it. In deep sleep, when the\nmind subsides, there is no Sansar and neither happiness nor\nsorrow. So, happiness and sorrow are apparent (Mithya); their\ncause is the mind. This mind must be tamed and its extrovert\ntrend must be controlled by Pranayam etc. Keep your mind crystal\nclear and the world will be looking like a picture.\nThis is easy to say and hear but difficult to directly\nexperience. We see the world but it does not mean that it is real.\nAt sunrise or sunset, sometimes with certain cloud formations,\nwe can see a Gandharva-nagari (to which there are references\nin the Upanishads), looking like chariots, human beings,\ndwellings etc., but really it is all nothing but cloud formations!\nSimilaly, here in Canada, you may have observed on highways\nwhat looks like water on the road ahead but really it is a mere\nreflection of light. We take this body as Atma, but, there is\nsomething which is not the body nor the mind nor the intellect\netc. We must try to understand what IT is then. Misunderstanding\nour body for the Atma is due to Maya. How to conquer this Maya?\nVashistha enumerates the steps:\n(Continued...)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202210","type":"Document"}

That self-luminous principle of awareness called\nSamvit, which spread itself out in the vivid experience\nof the triple states of wakefulness, dream and deep-\nsleep; that indwelling witness of the objective world\nwhich makes itself universally felt in all living beings-\n-from the world-fashioner Brahma down to an\ninsignificant ant; that Samvit verily am I and not any\nperceived object.\nHe who is possessed of such strong realisation,\nbe he of the lowliest or of the holiest birth, he is the\nGuru. This is my considered opinion.\nThe poem opens with a definition of samvit given\nin the first half of the first sholka. Brahma is the\nancient or the initial being, who initiates a cycle of\ncreation. Pipeelika  is an ant, representing a\nrudimentary structure of sentient being. You may\ntake this to be an amoeba if you want. From Brahma\nto pipeelika you have the entire field of experiential\nlife. This is jagat.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202218\nExpanse of Samvit\nIn it is the seer ( sakshee) running like a fine\nthread holding all beads of experience. And the\nexperiences themselves form the three-storeyed\nstructure of life--jagrat (waking), svapna (dream) and\nsushupti (deep-sleep). Through all these states what\nmanifests is the expanse of samvit.\nLike this you are expected to experience prajna,\nthis conviction you must inculcate. It should be a\nfirm conviction,  dridha prajna .\nConsciousness is Uttered Word\nRecall what was stated by the chandaala first.\nSri Shankara never raised the question of this\ndifference. Only, he said, gaccha gaccha . We have\nseen that a Sadhka of samvit does not take words\nas words in a dictionary. For him the uttered word\nis consciousness. In life usually we are concerned\nonly with the meaning of words and that too if they\ncomply with our own corrupted and illogical\nexpectations. The truth and beauty of the situation\nare completely eliminated. Life becomes a mere\nfighting with words and getting frustrated with the\nbehaviour of others. We eat only the husk of\nexperience and remain always famished.\nTherefore, the chandaala, in trying to bring out\nthe prajna behind the casual words of the acharya,\nproved himself to be of a stature which Sri Shankara\nwas quick to recognise as that of the guru. Sri\nShankara was too much soaked with samvit, too\nmuch of a guru himself, to be misled into discussion.\nReconsider the word prajna. Pra=clarification,\ndevelopment; Jna=the stuff out of which knowledge\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202219\nrises. This involves a process which is called yoga,\nYogis developed prajna through years of practice, till\nthey experienced it as aviplava (neither diminishing\nnor increasing) or as aparimita (the uncontained or\nmeasureless).\nLight of Vedas\nThis is the only idol which all yogis all over the\nworld--be they Buddhist, Christian or Sufi or any\naboriginal tribes--worship and attend to. Perhaps,\nfor any human being, be he a yogi or not, this is the\nonly worshipful light of the Vedas, Varenyam\nBhargah.\nThe Vedas hold that human life is meant for and\ndesigned to an intensification of consciousness that\nSamvit is. Samvit means clarity and knowledge. So\nyou have to handle your prajna and make it as clear\nand deep as possible. Certainly, the mystery of\nconsciousness, samvit, does not lie in the field of\nconsciousness, but in the heart of it.\nSo the Master says, \"Break the borders of\nconsciousness, penetrate the fringers of experience.\"\nYou are breaking it every day-in waking, dreaming\nand sleeping; only you need  to focus your awareness.\nSee how this breaking of the borders comes in an\nirresistible, natural and exciting flow of life:\npeeie'ledmJeHvemeg<egefHle<eg mHegAileje 3ee mebefJeogppe=cYeles.\nNow the Master adds, \"Try to feel the point of\nthis light, the heart of all experience, in whose gaze\nthe fields come and go. This coming and going is the\nSamvit ujjrumbhana; for, actually things do not come\nand go, samvit goes from field to field creating things.\nCatch hold of the beauty of this transformation and\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202220\nnot the forms of transformation or the process and\nconsequences of it.\nWhere does the beauty of jaagrat-svapna-sushupti\nlie? In the fact that you were waking, you were\ndreaming, you slept and that very same you have\nawakened. But for this, life will be terrible.\nSomeone's jaagrat, someone else's svapna, a third\none's sushupti put together make no meaning. They\nare three disjoined pictures.\nFor life you need a sustaining thread of meaning;\na thread holding different flowers, creating a garland;\na regular sequence giving a story-form to a moving\ncinema film. But for the continuity and sequence,\nthe cinema will be reduced to a monotomously long\ndisplay of slides or at the most, a pell-mell projection\nof a trailer.\nThere is something which gives sequence and\ncohesion to your life. Discover that in you or place\nyourself in it. Saa eva aham --this is the placing; if\nthis is achieved, then, whether the scene grows or\ngoes it matters not. They are treated as just ieleemeg\ngatasu and Deieleemeg agatasu, coming and going. You\nhold their mystery in you and so there is neither\nsorrow not exultation.\nAfter stating the developments of prajna, its\ntranscendental form is told in the second line of this\nverse.\nAs the witnessing light it threads through all\nexperiences. This threading of the samvit is referred\nto in the Gita also. But human language is very\nweak. Thread, beads, etc., create a gross picture.\nHere samvit is not a gross thread. It becomes the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202221\nbead in one pulsation and remains the thread next\nmomnet and pulsates again to become the next\nbead of experience. Thus it goes on in the quantum\nway.\nIn this is the deathlessness of samvit which it\ndemonstrates by going through a thousand deaths.\nYou go through the waking, dreaming and sleeping\nstates fearlessly and naturally. You do not tremble\nand weep or think that once you fall asleep you will\nbe annihilated. You do not think that there is no\nguarantee that you will wake up again here. No one\nwho is normal will do that. Yet one goes on worrying\nabout old age and what will happen after that.\nIf in jagrat, etc., you as samvit were intact\nyesterday, you will be so tomorrow also and the day\nafter and so also next year and during the years to\ncome. If you as samvit  sustained these\ntransformations from the birth of the body to its fall,\nwhat makes you doubt that it will not retain itself\nin taking another body, a hundred more bodies?\nTest of Prajna\nThe entire world is designed for this test ofprajna.\nIt is, therefore, made like a cloud, melting every\nmoment. If your house starts melting like a cloud\nwill you not panic? But any sane person with normal\nintelligence should not do so. As for a samvit\nsadhaka, he will not only not panic but be able to\nsee the beauty of that melting in the vast sky of\nsamvit. Entire worlds rise and vanish like clouds\nalmost every day in cosmic calender. One who is\nendowed with prajna should, in certain respects, be\nlike a child to enjoy this.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202222\nChild Nature\nYajnavalkya advises, \"Remain in child-nature.\"\nHow intensely does a child watch a cloud and how\nthoroughly it enjoys it! That fire-filled, water-laden,\nmassive cloud is growing and growing, and in a trice\ngone, only the sky endures, smiling as ever. That is\nthe beauty and meaning of the display.\nThus, the first shloka of the poem yields a grand\nview of all bodies and all worlds, from the most\nhighly developed to the utterly rudimentary,\ninterpenetrated by one shimmering essence of\nconsciousness. We discover the golden thread of\nsamvit with which the harp of the universe is strung.\n(Continued...)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar,\nMt.

Sanyasins settle down on this\nday to commence their Chaturmasya, to be spent\nmostly in giving discourses on religious themes, and\nin meditation.\nTo master an art, a science or any utilitarian skill,\nwe undergo training at the hands of an expert in that\nfield. Adhyatma Vidya--the Science of the Self--is the\nqueen of all sciences. Lord Krishna looks upon it, in\nGita, as one of His Vibhutis (special manifestations)\n(DeO3eelceefJeDee efJeDeeveeced.X-32). It, therefore, stands to reason\nthat we cannot properly assimilate it without the hand\nof help the Guru--the expert in Adhyatma Vidya--\ngraciously extends to us. The supreme aim of man\nconsists in losing the crippling consciousness that he\nis just a Narakara (vejekeAej)  and merging into the\nNirakara (efvejekeAej), the Formless Being--God.

Purusha Sukta states that\nthe moon sprang forth from the Mind of the Supreme\nBeing ((r)ebecee cevemees peele:). The mind shares the vagaries\nof the moon. Like it, the mind waxes and wanes and\nundulates between joy and grief, hope and despair--\nthe Shuklapaksha and the Krishnapaksha of the\nmind. Yoga Vasistha says, \"If there is peace within,\nthe whole world looks cool and pleasing; but, if the\nfire of desires burns within, then the whole world\nappears ablaze to us. When one's mind is full, the\nwhole world appears to him to be full of sweet\nambrosia, just as, to a man putting on a pair of shoes\nthe whole earth appears to be covered with leather.\"\nDevle:Meerleuelee3eeb leg ueyOee3eeb Meerleueb peieled~\nDevlemle=<CeesHeleHleeveeb oeJeeoence3eb peieled~~\nHetCex ceveefme mecHetCeY= peielmeJeY= megOeeeJew:~\nGHeeveodietae{ Heeom3e veveg (r)ecee&mle=lewJeYet:~~\nTo convey this tranquillity and soothing quality of\nthe mind of a Mahatma, the only adequate simile is\nthat of a full-moon. That state is indeed the Purnima\nof our mind when it is full and brimming with ananda,\nshanti and prema. In the words of Sadashiva\nBrahmendra, the mystic radiates 'Poornendu shishira\nbhava', i.e. the coolness of the full-moon. Our revered\nGuruparampara is full of such mystics who radiate\nand shower all those who bask in their presence with\nthis coolness of the full-moon. Every true Guru is\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202227\nfirmly established in it and would surely help the\nearnest seeker to taste it too. The full-moon on the\ndistant sky is a glowing reminder to us that we should\nlet our mind evolve into the fullness of joy, peace and\nlove.\nVeda Vyasa is rightly regarded as Adi-Guru (First\nPreceptor) and the Loka-Guru (World Preceptor). A\nwell-known verse says, \"Badarayana is Brahma minus\nfour faces, Hari with two hands, and Shambhu without\nHis eye on the forehead.\" He is acknowledged as the\ntowering spokesman of our Dharma and philosophy.\nHe is called Parashara because he was the son of\nParashara, Krishna Dvaipayana because he was dark\n(krishna) in complexion and was born on a raised spot\nencircled by Yamuna and which looked like an island\n(Dvipa), Badarayana because a cluster of jujube\n(badari) trees grew where he was born, and Vyasa\nbecause he classified (vivyasa) the Vedic lore into four\nSamhitas. Rig, Yajus, Sama and Atharva Veda.\nOne of the invocatory verses in Gita refers to Vyasa\nas 'Vishala Buddhi' (\"of comprehensive intelligence\")\nand this tribute is well-deserved. Apart from classifying\nthe Vedas into the four well-known Samhitas\n(collections), Vyasa composed Brahma Sutras,\nMahabharata and eighteen Puranas. In doing so, he\ntouched upon every facet of knowledge and hence it\nis said, \"This world is the spittle of Vyasa.\"(J3eemeeseq(r)iaced\nFob peieled). All this is a staggering achievement indeed,\nand truly all our subsequent religious literature is\njust a series of footnotes to the utterances of Vyasa.\nTradition hails Vyasa as one of the seven deathless\nbeings (chiranjeevis). Vyasa is immortal by virtue of\nhis works wherein are spelled out the basic premises\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202228\nof Hinduism, viz. the conception of the One Supreme\nBeing who is called variously by the wise, the theory\nof divine incarnations (Avatar) for the revival of Dharma,\nthe doctrine of Karma and rebirth, the conception of\nDharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha as the four primary\nends of human endeavour, the schemes of Varna and\nAshrama, the conception of Jnana, Bhakti and Karma\nas the three pathways to God, and the characterisation\nof God as Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshvara in relation\nto His creation, sustenance and dissolution of the\nuniverse, etc. As our Dharma is eternal, so is Vyasa\neternal and deathless.\nVyasa has bequeathed to us a rich legacy. We are\nreminded of this legacy and the remarkable man who\nbequeathed it to us, at least once a year -- on the day\nof Guru Pumima. Our obligation and duty to Vyasa is\ntwo-fold: i) We should study his works, at least his\nMahabharata and Bhagavata, ii) We should imbibe\nhis teachings and live upto his expectations as best\nas we can. Vyasa, the Adi-Guru and the Loka-Guru,\nis the animating spirit of every true Guru. Every\nspiritual preceptor acts as the interpretor of Vyasa\nand speaks in the accents of Vyasa; hence, Guru\nPurnima and Vyasa Purnima are observed on the\nsame day. The mission of every Guru is to keep alive\nin the world the memory and the immortal teachings\nof Vyasa.\nVyasa's message to the world : There is a well-\nknown verse, \"The essence of Vyasa's teachings in all\nthe eighteen Puranas is summed up in two of his\nutterances: Punya consists in doing a good turn to\nsomeone and Papa (HeeHe) in causing distress.\" This is a\nsound guide-line for our conduct.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202229\nThe parting message of Vyasa is contained in two\nverses at the close of Mahabharata. Just as Gayatri is\nthe secret and the essence of the Vedas, these two\nverses contain the secret of the fifth Veda, i.e.\nMahabharata; hence they go by the name - Bharata\nSavitri. Vyas, who toiled unceasingly for propagating\nDharma by the might of his writings, finds in the\nevening of his life that the world is not yet ready to\nlisten to him. In disillusionment, he throws up his\nhands and wails:\nTOJe&yeengefJe&jewc3es<e ve (r)e keAef 1/2eled The=Ceesefle ces~\nOecee&oLe& 1/2e keAece 1/2e me Oece&: efkebA ve mesJ3eles~~\nve peeleg keAeceeVe Ye3eeVe ueesYeeod, Oece& l3epesppeerefJelem3eeefHe nslees:~\nOeceex efvel3e: megKeog:Kes lJeefvel3es peerJees efvel3ees nslegjm3e lJeefvel3e:~~\n\"With uplifted hands I shout; alas! None, listens!\nFrom observance of righteousness (Oece&), follow wealth\n(DeLe&)  and pleasure (keAece) . Then, why is this\nrighteousness not observed? Be it remembered that\nDharma should never be abandoned to fulfill the\ndemands of Kama. Dharma should not be forsaken\nthrough fear or greed or even when one's life is at\nstake. For, Dharma is eternal, while the joys and\nsorrows of life are fleeting and transitory, even as the\nsoul is eternal, though the means and instruments it\nuses are but frail and transient.\"\nThis is the call of Vyasa and, indeed, of every\nSadguru. \"Alas, none listens\" laments Vyasa. Pray let\nus listen to him and practise his precepts as best as\nwe can. This is the Call of Guru Purnima or Vyasa\nPurnima.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Thus, Shiva is also\nknown as Neelkanth, literally\nmeaning The Blue Throated\nOne.\n@\nCredits:\nlittleravikiran@gmail.com\nhttps://www.thebetterindia.com\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=65224566\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neelkanth_Mahadev_T emple_(Rishikesh\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11224634\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202239\nBy Unknown (production) - https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O68648/painting-kurma-the-\ntortoise-incarnation-of/, Public Domain,\nEditors:Dil\nLittle Ravikiran created with love by ChandrimaKalbag and Jyothi\nBharat Divgi\nipBasrur and Dr.GaurishPadukone\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18764737\nhttps://animalstratosphere.com/\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Pride of\nvictory led Agni to boast that the success was due to\nhis power, Vayu ascribed it to his own and in the\nsame way, the different gods began to praise their\nrespective strength. Then the Parabrahman assumed\nthe form of a Yaksha, stood before the gods, and\nexamined their powers one by one. Agni, who boasted\nthat he could burn down the universe with his power,\nfound that he could not, with all his might, burn down\neven a blade of grass. Similarly, not all the attempts\nof Vayu could so much as move the blade. The gods,\nwho had thus to pocket their pride, then sent Indra\nbefore the said Yaksha, who took the form of Uma,\ndaughter of Himavat, and told Indra that the victory\nwas due to the Power of the Parabrahman alone.\nPeople attain perfection by worshipping, in the\nform of Gayatri etc., the Power thus described. The\nworship of this Power, which is not distinct from the\nParabrahman, is the main thing in the procedure\nprescribed for the Navaratra.

But it does not appear that there is any trace\nof animal sacrifice or of the use of liquor or flesh in\nthe course of the worship at that place. The\nPrapanchsara of Shri Shankaracharya mentions a\nvariety of modes of worship, but does not prescribe\nthe use of liquor anywhere. The Vaikritikarahasya of\nthe Saptashati clearly says : \"Nowhere is prescribed\nthe method of worship with this sacrifice, liquor, flesh\netc.\" The Smritis reckon the drinking of liquor as one\nof the five great sins. Hence it is desirable that\nBrahmans should, in accordance with Dharmashastra,\ngive up the use of liquor in the course of Devi Archana.\nSome people maintain that, if this method is given\nup, it results in the displeasure of the Deity. But will\nthe feeling of such displeasure remain when the\nprohibition programme initiated by the present\nGovernment is universally adopted? Those who call\nthemselves the Sanatanists of the Community do not\nseem to defy the Sarda Act. Again, to give up the use\nof liquor in accordance with Dharmashastra is far\nbetter than to abandon it through fear of the law.\nAnd, as Bhartrihari says, to give up, of one's own\naccord, an abject which must go some day, would bring\npeace of mind as well.\nAt the same time, it is a matter of consideration\nfrom the spiritual point of view, that, while patriots\nwould place a ban on the asavas and arishtas of the\nAyurveda as being on the same footing as liquor, they\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 20227\nare apt to hold up drinking of neera as an orthodox\nand unobjectionable practice. But rather than enter\ninto the politics of the matter, we would express the\nhope that all will strive to establish the reputation that\nthere is no one in the Community who drinks liquor\nin any shape or form.\nIt has been made clear before that there is no room\nwhatever in the Bhagavata Dharma for such evil\npractices. Accordingly, no one need be under the\nimpression that this practice is in keeping with the\nBhagavata tradition.\nMay the Paramatman grant that all may secure\nhappiness and liberation by worshipping Shakti with\nleaves, flowers, fruits and the like alone in accordance\nwith the views expressed by Shri Shankaracharya!\nJune 2022\n01 Wednesday Samaaraadhanaa at Shirali -\nSwami Pandurangashram Sannidhi\n05 Sunday Vardhanti at Shirali -\nSwami Anandashram Sannidhi\n07 Tuesday Vardhanti at Mangaluru -\nSwami Vamanashram Sannidhi\n09 Thursday Vardhanti at Mallapur -\nSwami Shankarashram-II Sannidhi\n10 Friday Vardhanti at Kundapura -\nShri Sacchidananda Dattatreya Sannidhi\n14 Tuesday Vata-Savitri Vratam\n15 Wednesday Janma Divasa of Swami Parijnanashram-III\n18 Saturday Vardhanti at Kundapura -\nJogayya Venkataramana Sannidhi\n21 Tuesday Dakshinayana Prarambha\nFESTIVALS IN JUNE 2022\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

When Prakriti is strong(teevra),\nunderstanding is weak.

When we are in the mother's womb,\nwe say 'I AM THAT' (Soham) but once we are out of\nwomb and perceive this bewildering world, we say\n'WHO AM I?' (Koham). We get enveloped by Ignorance.\nEither we cry or make others cry or others make us\ncry!\nAs we grow, we get entangled in outer experiences\nand our sense organs fall a victim to their\nenchantments. If we find something pleasurable today,\ntomorrow we will turn to the same thing. When this is\nrepeated indefinitely, attachment (sanga)  to that\npleasure develops. One goes after beautiful women,\nanother after gold, wealth, etc. This is bondage\nbecause these attachments never give you complete\nsatisfaction or contentment (Satvic Samadhan),\nhowever much one may indulge in them. They yield\nonly temporary pleasure (anitya sukha). Everlasting\njoy (nitya sukha) is gained only by the company of\nthe wise (satsang).\nThis is what Kapila told his dear mother.\nWe now briefly touch upon Our Guruswami's\nUpadesh which is suited to moderm times. \"Do at least\nfive Gayatri Mantra japa. Daily Follow Vaidik Dharma.\nTake proper care of elders, parents and the guests.\nDo regular japa. Perform the essential of Pancha\nMahayajnaas. Do the Shraadha without fail\", etc.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202210\nHis Holiness spoke of Dharma, Nityasukha, Jnana\netc, often employing Vedantic parlance like\nGhataksha, Mathakasha, Mahakasha, etc. and not all\ncould understand His Pravachans very easily. After\nPravachan lasting for one and a half hours, many said\n: \"It was wonderful\", but few could recollect what they\nheard. Soon after Our Shishya Sweekar, we too could\nnot understand Him as we had not developed sufficient\ninterest in the subject. But, after His Holiness gave\nUs the book entitled KAPILOPADESHA to read, We\ndeveloped an absorbing interest (DeemeeqkeIle)  in His\nPravachans.\nSwamiji stressed Yoga and Bhakti. His frequent\nquote from Gita was\nDevev3e(r)3eslee: meleleb 3ees ceeb mcejefle efvel3eMe:~\nlem3eenb megueYe: HeeLe& efvel3e3egkeIlem3e osefnve:~~ ( VIII-14)\nHerein are given, in this verse, four qualifications\nby Lord Krishna : One must remember (1)\nsinglemindely (Devev3e(r)eslee:) (2) constantly (meleleced) (3) daily\n(efvel3eMe:) (4) ever steadfast (efvel3e3egkeIle:) To such a devotee,\nthe goal is easy to reach.\nHis Holiness also recommended the Japa of OM\n(Pranava Japa) along with an understanding of what\nOM stands for : lem3e Jee(r)ekeA: OeCeJe: leppeHe: leoLe&YeeJeveced~ Likewise,\nSwamiji stressed not only the Japa of Gayatri, but\nalso proper understanding of its meaning.\nWhen Prakriti appears, the Atma Tatva goes out of\nsight. Today, Gowri has arrived. She is Adi Maya, the\nprimal Prakriti (Nature) and it occurs to us that no\nsooner She came than the Atma Tatva personified in\nHis Holiness shuffled off the coils of Prakriti (i.e.\nphysical body) and merged into Brahman.

Don't\nbe scared of Prapancha. It is sustained by Ganapati.\nWhen the final moment came to depart,\nGuruswami chanted the sacred OM and left His body.\nGowri came and He left behind the Prakriti and\nmerged Himself into Brahman.

Yet, in the\nBhashyas, he never speaks about himself and seldom\nuses the first person, except perhaps to say, \"Now\nwe are going to comment upon this.\"\nContrary to this, in the Maneesha Panchakam,\nit is all in the first person. \"This is my considered\nopinion\" is the strain that goes on repeating itself\nthrough the shlokas. It is the burden of the whole\nsong. Here the Acharya gives his own considered\nopinion of what a Guru is. Since the Acharya is\nhimself a world-teacher, we can take this to be his\nself-description. So, here we have not only a\ndefinition but a self-portrait of a Guru.\nIn this poem, we have instead of the philosophy\nof Sri Shankara, his own state of consciousness.\nInstead of the words of the Guru we have the Guru\nhimself. This is the samvit approach. In it we do not\ndeal with concepts, we enter into experience. We do\nnot work out equations, we go for realization. He is\nthe Guru, for whom duality has vanished like a\nmagician's trick. That is what the world of duality is.\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI ISWARANANDA  GIRIJI\nMAHARAJ\nPORTRAIT OF GURU\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202219\nDuality--Power of Creator\nA magician conjures up a vision, a scene, which\nyou see as a reality in front of you but actually it\nis not there, it rests in the magician, it is all his\nglory. So he withdraws it within himself. The duality\nof the entire world is due to the power of its creator,\nIshvara. Therefore, to make that dvaita melt is also\nin his power. When he does that he is designated\nas the Guru. This is the speciality.\nThe Interlude\nAn incident happened in Varanasi where Sri\nShankara was staying. One early morning Sri\nShankara was returning from a bath in the holy\nGanges. As is the tradition even now with all monks,\nhe proceeded to have the first darshana of Sri\nVishveshvara as soon as the temples gates opened.\nIn his water-pot he carried Ganges water for the\nabhisheka of the jyotirlingam. In the semi-darkness\nof pre-dawn Sri Shankara found his way virtually\nblocked by what appeared to be the bulky and\nformidable form of a low-caste sweeper, a chandala.\nInstinctively, the Acharya cried in dismay, \"Away,\nmove away.\" In fact the chandala was a camouflage\nof that same Shiva who had come to bless the earth\nin the human form of the Acharya! Here is a subtle\nimagination of supposition to set the stage for the\nrecollection of unified consciousness.\nWithout budging an inch from the path the\nchandala retorted, \"What do you want to be removed\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202220\nby ordering, 'go away, go away'? Is it my perishable\nbody--is that not composed of the same five elements\nas yours? Is it my Self? Why, there is only one Self\nthat permeates all bodies!\" Shankara was\nflabbergasted and realised this simple truth.\nThat is the samvit approach. You should not take\nthe apparent meaning which is obvious. What is\napparent is not to be talked about, need not even\nbe dwelt upon. One must try to catch hold of the\nexperience of the speaker which is meant to be\ntransmitted through words or gestures. This is the\nbeauty of Samvit sadhana : The chandala or the\nshishya enters into the Guru, trying to be the Guru\nof the Guru, and the Guru or Shankara enters into\nthe Shishya with child-like impetuosity and\nquestioning wonder.\nThe chandala provokes Shankara by asking,\n\"When the sun gets reflected simultaneously in the\nGanges water and the pool in a chandala's backyard,\ntell me--is there any difference in the sun?\" In that\nindwelling reality of the spirit, which is like unto a\nwaveless ocean of unborn bliss, it is equally\nuntenable to raise distinctions like \"this is a\nbrahmin\", \"this is a chandala,\" etc. Are they not\ngreat illusion? So, Shankara sees the greatness of\nthe chandala's perception and bursts out into five\nshlokas  out of his own experience, when the\nchandala reveals himself as Lord Vishveshvara.\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar, Mt.

His external achievements, however, are\naccompanied by inner conflicts and this is what\nmakes him so violent. His greed for money,\nsupremacy, power and other sensual enjoyments\nmakes him overlook whether the means to obtain\nthem are fair or unfair. With everyone trying to\namass things for oneself, there is intense competition\nand consequent mental ill-health everywhere.\nThe Gita prescribes a simple treatment for\novercoming greed thus, 'It is desire, it is lust born out\nof active quality (rajas) which is all devouring,\nprompting man to sin. Know this as the real enemy\nin this world (3.37). Desire is the inner enemy. In the\nprocess of fulfillment of desires, one faces obstacles\nand they obstruct the fulfillment of desire, which in\nturn gives rise to anger, anger leads to confusion and\nfrom confusion come all wrong actions. (2.62,63)\nMan must know that greed cannot be overcome\nby satisfying it; yielding to it only brings more greed.\nIt is just like trying to douse a fire by pouring butter\ninto it.\nThe whole plan of creation is to make us\nunderstand that we are divine. Acquisition of wealth\ncannot make us fulfilled, though it might fulfill\ncertain material needs. Says the Isha Upanishad,\nma gridhah kasya sviddhnam- do not covet anybody's\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202222\nwealth. In other words, learn to value the Atman,\nand not seek false security of material wealth, which\nis subject to change and decay. Mahatma Gandhi\nrightly said, 'There is enough on this earth to meet\nthe needs of all men but not enough to meet the\ngreed of a single man.' Instead of turning within,\nthe man takes an opposite direction and thus loses\nthe proper view of life. If you move out of the very\nsource of bliss, the Atman, how can you expect to\nget it in mere objects? Look at the gruesome result\nof running after the greed. Mental depression and\nsuicides born of unfaithfulness, violence, cheating,\nand hypocrisy are on the rise. In our pursuit to find\npeace in sense-pleasure, we have only found greater\nrestlessness. Hence, Sri Krishna said, ' Therefore,\ncontrolling first the senses, kill this sinful thing, the\ndestroyer of knowledge and wisdom.' (3.43)\nThe way to Control the Mind....\nSelf-knowledge alone leads to eternal life. Says\nSwami Vivekananda, \"All the religions of the world\nhave been built upon that one universal and\nadamantine foundation of all our knowledge -direct\nexperience.' The Gita is a yogashastra and teaches\nus how to concentrate the mind. Says Sri Krishna,\n\"Let the yogi attempt constantly to keep the mind\nsteady, remaining alone, with the mind and body\ncontrolled, free from desire and possession.\" (6.10)\nIf one wants to gain success in meditation, one\nshould be moderate in all one's actions-eating,\nrecreation, sleep, work and so on. This gradually\ncalms the mind. A calm mind develops concentration\nand that is the only way to reach the goal of human\nlife- discovering the inherent divine essence of life.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202223\nKrishna says that a man of meditation, 'sees the\nSelf abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self.\"\n(6.29) This seeing the same divine everywhere brings\nan end to all the distractions of the mind.\nSeeking True Unity :\nIt is quite fashionable to talk of 'One Humanity'\nthese days. Different bodies, political or otherwise,\nhave been formed to achieve the same. There are\nattempts to make the world one through globalization\nand information technology. Or there are attempts to\nmake everyone convert into one religion. But all this\nis artificial oneness based more or less on selfishness.\nLook at Arjuna's arguments when he was faced\nwith the task of fighting a war. He said \"How shall\nI fight with arrows, Bhishma and Drona in the\nbattlefield who are worthy of worship?\" (2.4) He never\nthought what would happen to people who are ready\nto die in the battlefield under the Pandava-banner\nif Duryodhana is allowed a free hand. He became\nconcerned with his own emotions only.\nSimilarly there are plenty of people in the world\nwho are concerned about their own feelings. There are\npeople who think that if all people in the world are\nmade to follow one religion then there will be world\nunity and advocate conversion to their religion only.\nThe Gita on the other hand tries to bring unity\nby preaching the truth behind the universe. There\nis only one Self, the pure consciousness, which is\nthe common element present in all. Just as the\nocean is the common factor for all waves, foam and\nwater bubble in the ocean, so also the Self is common\nto all forms of manifestation in the universe. Says\nSri Krishna,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202224\n\"All beings in the universe are woven together\nlike pearls of different shapes and qualities strung\ninto a single garland.\" (7.7)\nGod is One but His Names are Many\nIn today's fundamentalist world, a fanatic is prone\nto claim that his God alone is merciful and whoever\ndoes not believe in his God is doomed forever. So\nevery human being on this earth must come to his\nfaith. Gita asks such narrow-minded people gently,\n'If all are His children, where is the question of this\nfaith or that faith? Are not all people following the\nsame God, whatever be the differences in His\nnames?' Says Sri Krishna ,\n\"Whatsoever forms any devotee desires to worship\nwith faith-that same faith of his, I make firm and\nunflinching.\" (7.21)\nThe Lord understands that His children are varied\nin their temperaments. This attitude of acceptance\nin approach is the only path to end religious violence.\nHow to follow the Scriptures\nScriptures are meant to guide man to God. To\nknow God is to become unselfish. Though absolute\nunselfishness is the goal, one attains this by gradually\novercoming selfishness. This is often done by trial\nand error method in which one learns to overcome\nselfish desires through discovering their uselessness\nin giving everlasting satisfaction and contentment.\nScriptures prescribe this gradual approach to the\nhighest goal only because most people are not ready\nfor the highest and need to be guided in graded\nmanner. But people with ulterior selfish motives\nquote the scriptures to serve their selfish ends. It is\nlike the devil quoting the scripture.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202225\nArjuna too quoted scriptures in favour of his\narguments not to fight in the battlefield. Sri Krishna,\nthe God incarnate, easily found out how Arjuna was\nquoting the scriptures only in order to justify his\nown selfish stand. He thus gave him a jolt by telling\nthat all this he was exhibiting was Kashmala - the\ndirt of dejection. And then asked him, 'From where\ndid you get this? (2.2). This friendly nudge woke\nhim up and, as good student, he soon became willing\nto learn. Rest is what Gita is.\nSri Krishna was an ideal teacher. Hence after he\nfinished his discourse on what is right and how to\nfollow it in life, he asked Arjuna to reflect upon it\nand act as per his wish- 'yathechhasi tatha kuru .'\n(18.63) This implies that scriptures are to be well\nstudied, reflected upon with full devotion and\nconcentration, and then followed in life. The inner\ntruths are revealed when one studies them in silence\nand seclusion. Then and then alone can one quote\nthe teachings for one's own benefit and that of others.\nConclusion\nThus we see how the Gita offers its teachings to\nthe modern man in distress and guides him out of\nhis present predicament. For all maladies the Gita\noffers the solution: spiritual outlook towards life and\nliving a sincere life of inner and outer integrity and\nchanging the world through self-change . Rightly\ndoes the meditation-shloka (O3eeve MueeskeA)  on the Gita\ncall the message of the Gita as mother's counsel, 'I\nmeditate upon Thee, O loving Mother, the Bhagavad\nGita, the destroyer of all misery born of materialism.'\n(Courtesy : Vedanta Kesari, November 2006)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

But there is no reason why we need\nto fool around on those days unless we really choose\nto do so. Because, Yugadi swings in every year to\nremind us that all is not lost and we can still make\na new start. Yuga means an era and Yugadi is meant\nto motivate us to make a new beginning, putting the\npast behind us. Come Yugadi, we should resolve to\nopen a new chapter in our lives.\nTo indicate new year, we say Nootana Samvatsara\nin Sanskrit. The new year that made its debut on\nApril 2 is called Shubhakratu. Let us do a bit of\nvimarsha on these three words.\nThe word nootana greets us for the first time in\nAgni Sookta, the very first hymn in the most ancient\nRigveda Deeqivee HetJe&sefYee $eYef<eefYee F&[3ees vetlevew(c)le , says the text.\n\"Agni is worthy of adoration not only by the ancient\nsages, but even by the nootana ones.\" Spiritual values\ndon't carry an expiry date.

What is nootana or new about the New\nYear is simply that it presents us with a new\nopportunity to better ourselves.

RAJAGOPAL BHAT\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202227\nover a new leaf, its so called novelty is lost upon us.\nVatsara means the chronological year. As the\ndictionary would tell us, it derives from vas (to abide)\nand sara (to move). Everything abides in time and\ntime is always ticking away. When the enriching\nprefix 'sam' is tagged on, then Vatsara becomes\nSamvatsara. Vatsara is just a measure of time.\nSamvatsara is value-oriented. We should not merely\nexist, but live rightly and justly. \"Sam\" means \"well\".\nIt also means \"together\" (mecYet3e). When this \"sam\"\nfactor enlivens the year, it is Samvatsara.\nThere are Vedic sermons to us: \"sangacchadhvam,\nsamvadadhvam, sam vo manamsi janatam\" (Go\ntogether, speak with one voice, know each other's\nmind very well) etc. Unity and harmony should be\nthe keynote of our life at all levels - domestic, social,\nnational or international. The more these values\nsuffuse our days, the better the year (vatsara) truly\nblossoms into a Samvatsara. If discord and disharmony\nmark our days, then life loses its savour. We just\nmark time, that's all. It is no longer a Samvatsara.\nBetween the two poles of Prabhava (origin) and\nKshaya (extinction) - the 1st and 60th year\nrespectively - our brief sojourn on this planet is a\nkaleidoscope of colourful experiences, a rough and\ntumble vividly signified by the 58 names in between.\nEach name is an invitation to quiet reflection.\nSamvatsara is also a name of Lord VishNu. It is\nno. 91 and 422  In VishNu Sahasranama. Acharya\nShankara comments that God is so called because\nall beings nicely (mec3eJedA) abide (Jemeeqvle) in Him.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202228\nThe year that just took leave of us was Plava\n(boat) and the year that has made its debut is\nSHUBHAKRATU (good thoughts, good deeds). Plava\nwas preceded by Sharvari (night) and earlier to it\nwas Vikari (full of vile modifications). These names\nare spiritual hints and we need to decode them to\ngrasp their message aright.\nWhen vagaries of mind - lust, anger, greed,\ninfatuation, arrogance and envy etc - sway our  soul,\nwe slip  into the darkness of TamoguNa. We stagger\nfrom one folly to another and then, lo,  the Guru,\nthe boatman par excellence, arrives with the boat\ncalled God (meleJeAerveeJe KesJeefi3ee meoieg(c) as the saint Meerabai\nputs it). What does the Guru do? He inspires us to\ncherish good thoughts and perform good deeds\n(SHUBHAKRATU).\n\"Let noble thoughts and deeds abound in the\nworld everywhere\" is our ageless Vedic prayer. ( Dee vees\nYeeee !eAleJees 3evleg efJeeelee  - RgVeda 1-89-1).\nOur prayers ( vevovleg meeOeJeAee meJex, meJex YeJevleg megefKevee  etc)\nare all examples of auspicious thoughts, taught to\nus by our Sadguru long, long before Shubhakratu\nyear swung in.  Good thoughts, good words and\ngood deeds - these are the legacy of a Master to his\ndisciples. They impart beauty and grace (ueeefuel3e) to\nour lives which would otherwise be drab and dreary.\nSwami Vivekananda said over a century ago: \"To\ndo good and to be good - this is the whole of\nreligion\".

Well\nit was a mixed feeling of real ecstasy and bit of fright\nwhen I got up with a jolt recollecting the dream since\nI had never visited Shirali Math till date.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202234\nI quickly hastened to take my bath, packed a small\nbag with change clothes and informed my wife about\nthe dream and dashed off to Shirali by the early\nmorning bus. As luck or destiny would have prevailed\nupon me, I got a 2x2 seater bus around 5:30 am from\nAndheri - East heading towards Mangalore.\nAs the Bus was approaching near Shirali, the bus\nconductor informed me that we will be arriving at\nShirali in just another 10 mins.\nTo my surprise, as we neared towards Shirali the\nKaman (Arch) was visible to my eyes and the driver\nslowed down the bus for me to get down. Once I\ndescended from the bus, I was overjoyed to have one\nmore close look at the Kaman (Arch) (seen in my\ndream) , and was guided by a local person to a rickshaw\nto take me to the Math.\nAs I reached the Math - the caretaker welcomed\nme and allocated me a room making me comfortable\nafter entering my personal details in the Office\nRegister. I had a bath, got ready and enquired with\nsome sadhaka where I could buy some flowers. I was\ndirected to go to Bhatkal where I picked up a bag full\nof Mallige. On my return to the Math, I offered (handed\nover) the Mallige for Sevas to Bhatmam near the Hodi\nSamadhi.\nOnce the Ratri Puja got over, I enquired with\nBhatmam, if I could meet Swamiji and have HIS\ndarshan. In a couple of minutes Bhatmam returned\nand directed me to Swamiji's Room which was then\nlocated on 1st floor above the Sevas booking and\nPublications Room led by a staircase.\nBhat Mam was kind enough to guide me to\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam May 202235\nSwamiji's room. As I pushed to open the door - I was\ngreeted by our GURU Swamiji with a broad Smile\nsitting in crossed legs, exactly as what I saw in my\ndream that morning - I prostrated on the floor offering\nShastang Namaskars and tears flowing down my eyes.\nAfter a while I recomposed my self and got up. However,\nto the left I was greeted by H. H. Sadyojat\nShankarashram Swamiji seated on His Asan with a\nradiant smile and HE Blessed me by placing his\nBestowing Hand over my head saying -\nGURUSWAMIJI's BLESSINGS are there upon you !\nAs I wiped my tears, Swamiji said \"Aji Devagale\nPooja Malligene Zalle\".\nI shared with HIM about my Dream** which\nbrought me to Shirali. HE just smiled again as if He\nknew it all and said HIS Gurushakti is upon all of\nus .\nAfter a brief exchange, I informed Him about my\nprogramme to leave Mumbai next morning, He Blessed\nme once again with Prasad, I bowed down to HIM and\nleft the room with a contented heart (TRUPT JAVNU).\nI left for Mumbai early morning the next day.\nThis incident was again one amongst my\npriceless memories of Samparka with our GURU\nSwamiji . We feel HIS presence every moment in\nour life. Besides He made me one to realize the\nstrong bond/ connection of GURUSHAKTI between\nour Guru Swamiji and H. H. Sadyojat\nShankarashram Swamiji for which Our Chitrapur\nSamaj are truly Blessed, and indebted to Our\nGuruparampara.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

All should remember this. It is of no use\ndoing Sadhana or Japa if you neglect your body. To\nbegin with, you should first take care of your body\nand  then  concentrate  on  your  Sadhana,  or  your\nJapa. Only then can the Sadhaka derive full fruits\nof  his  Sadhana and  Japa.  So,  even  if  we  or  His\nHoliness (Swami Anandashram) has advised you to\ndo  your  Japa  all  the  time,  to  maintain  your\ncontinuous  link  with  God,  you  can  think  of  God\nonly with a fully refreshed body.

He does everything. But, we tend\nto overlook His real form and only think of what all\nwe should do to attain Him. He has created us to\nsee if we will go within ourselves and use His Shakti\nto attain Him or whether we will remain engrossed\nin the objects and get lost in His manifestations\noutside us. Whether we go to Him or not, whether\nwe try to become one with Him or not - this is the\nreal test that He sets for us and He loves to go on\ntesting us every now and then, by plunging us into\nSansar, by giving us difficulties of every kind. So to\nenable people to increase their understanding of\nthe Lord's doings. Narada says here that once we\nare born on earth and are in            Sansar, we have\nnothing but difficulties. This, His Holiness\nAnandashram Swamiji had aslo said, so also had\nSwami Ramdas of Ramnagar. We can enjoy the\npleasures of the world only so long as man has\nstrength, his mind is strong and he is full of self-\nconfidence. But, as he grows older and his faculties\nbecome weak, then it becomes very difficult for a\nperson to carry on his      Sansar    and perform all his\nworldly acts that used to give him so much pleasure\nonce. You may have seen many examples of this.\nOur ancients tell us that even if we are happy and\nhave no difficulties, it only means that you have not\nyet struggled to attain the goal of life, your    Adhyatma\nVritti. This Shloka   of Narada is for      Sadhakas    only\nand teaches them how to attain God.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        9           May & June 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nNarada says that God gave him a glimmer of\nhappiness with His vision and then disappeared.\n              (c)Heb YeieJelees 3eled leled ceve:keAevleb Meg(r)eeHenced ~\n             DeHeM3eved menmeesEemLes JewkeAu3eeled ogce&vee FJe ~~\n                efoI#egmleonb Yet3e: OeefCeOee3e cevees Uefo ~\n             Jeer#eceeCeescefHe veeHeM3eced DeefJele=Hle FJeelegj: ~~\n    \"Even as I failed to perceive that indescribable\nform of God, which was enrapturing to the heart\nand dispelled all grief.

Now, I felt miserable like one\nwhose desire remains ever unfulfilled.\"\n    A sadhaka who meditates on Him sees God in a\nflash and then God disappears. The reason for His\ndoing so is this. To give an example, a poor man gets\na sum of Rs. 10,000. He feels so happy and elated\nand, then, suddenly, the whole money is snatched\nfrom his hands and it disappears. He becomes very\nmiserable and thinks of nothing else but his lost\ntreasure.

We implored Him to fortify our\ncommitment to the Path of Advaita. Adi Shankara did\nnot dwell only on the Nirguna. Nirakara Tatva. His\nthesis was that Brahman though Nirguna and Nirakara\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                               May  &  June  202311\n------- PAGE END -------\ncan and, indeed, does condense Himself into the Name\nand Form of the favourite deity (Ishta Devata) of the\nseeker to bless him and brighten his onward path.\n    Once the Acharya was in Varanasi, the renowned\ncentre of learning in those days. No commentary\nwritten by an Acharya could pass muster unless the\nPandits of Varanasi gave it their seal of approval. After\nan early morning dip in Ganges, Acharya was walking\ntowards the shrine of Lord Vishwanath, with the holy\nGanges water in hand to perform the abhisheka. The\nlane was very narrow. An 'untouchable' sweeper was\ncoming in the opposite direction. Acharya muttered\n\"gaccha gaccha\" (move aside, move aside) and was\nastonished when the untouchable snapped back. Are\nyou addressing these words to my body or Atman?\nYou advocate Advaita and swear by one Atman\nanimating one and all. So, your words are not\nunderstood by me. It did not take long for the Acharya\nto realise that the untouchable was none other than\nLord Vishwanath and He burst into a beautiful hymn\ncalled \"Maneesha Panchaka\"\n              peeuelmJeHvemeg<egeqHle<eg mHegAileje 3ee mebefJeogyebYeles\n            3ee ye'ieeefoefHeHeerefuekeAevleleveg<eg Oeeslee peielmeeef#eCeer~\n           mewJeenb ve (r)e C/M3eJeefml(r)eefle o={Oe%eecefHe 3em3eeefmle (r)esled\n          (r)eeC[eueescmleg me leg efUpeescmleg ieg(c)efjl3es<ee ceveer<ee cece~~\n    In the above verse, Acharya has given us a lakshana\nof the Guru. Be he an.'untouchable' by caste or a\nhighborn Brahmin, Kshatriya or Vaishya, one who\nhas totally identified himself with the Chit-shakti (also\ncalled as Samvit) is a Guru. Acharya spells out some\ndefining marks of this Chit-shakti. Everyone passes\nthrough the three states of waking, dream and sleep.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam           12            May & June 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nThese states come and go, but the I-notion underlying\nthem persists. Mine is the waking, mine the dream\nand the sleep too. \"I slept well, I did not know\nanything\" is our reaction upon getting up from a deep\nsleep. So, the Aham-tatva (the i-notion) is the string\non which the three states are threaded. This I-notion\nis rooted in Pure Chaitanya or Samvit. It is not the\nmonopoly of only mankind. It is the witnessing (sakshi\nchaitanya) consiousneee animating everyone from the\nlowly ant to the mighty Brahmadeva. This\nconsciousness cannot be many. It is one and one only.\nWhosoever has this Maneesha (deep conviction)., he\nis my Guru, no matter to which caste he belongs,\nsays Adi Shankara.\n    Today is Shankara Jayanti. Let us do some\nChintan on His words. We will take a few lines from\nHis Gita Bhashya. He says: Dharma enjoined by Vedas\nis two-fold. It is action-oriented (pravritti lakshana)\nand renunciation-oriented (nivritti lakshana). The\nformer is the way of life for householders, the latter\nfor the renunciates. This distinction is tentative and\nprovisional. It holds good at the beginning. In the end,\nwhen action is performed in the manner taught by\nthe Lord in Gita, it is as good as renunciation. When\nArjuna had to be provoked and aroused to act, Krishna\ntalks of the ignominy that would greet him if he flees\nthe battlefield. However, once Arjuna takes up the\nbow, once Arjuna is launched on pravritti dharma,\nthe Lord switches over to a higher reasoning. Krishna\ninstructs him how to sublimate work into worship,\nhow to make every act an offering, giving no room for\nconsiderations of phala or the fruits of action to\ninfluence him. When pravritti dharma is performed\nin this way, it is as good as nivritti dharma.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         13           May & June 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nWhatever duties fall to our lot, wherever we are\nstationed in life, let us turn them into offerings to the\nLord. This attitude cleanses our interior. It brings\nabout chitta-shuddhi. It brings about satva-shuddhi.\nIt qualifies you for receiving knowledge. It confers jnana\n-nishtha-yogyata. Slowly, the spirit of nivritti\n(retirement or withdrawal) soaks your pravritti, your\nday-to-day actions. In this way, your pravritti dharma\nand our nivritti dharma find a meeting point. Thinking\nalong these lines, We mix and mingle with you and\nhold satsangs together.All this gives us immense\nananda.\n    We have no doubt you are doing your duties with\nthis ishvara-arpana-buddhi. At times, you may feel\nuneasy and may have the uncomfortable feeling that\nyour progress is not upto the mark. Don't lose heart.\n    So, when We look back and observe how Our\nearlier Gurus responded to the spirit of their Age, it\nbecomes clear that the same Gurushakti that,\nanimated, Adi Shankara was also inspiring and\nguiding our Guruparampara.\n    'Adi Shankara had four disciples. Sureshvara was\na hardboiled ritualist (Karma-Kandin) until he was\nwon over by the Acharya. Mere intellectual allegiance\nto Advaita did not make him. blissful. Commanded:\nby Acharya, he went to Srishaila and propitiated Lord\nMallikarjuna and was later rewarded by the Advaitic\nexperience.\n    Another disciple, later called as Hastamalaka,\nhailed from Srivali, now our Shirali. As a boy, he looked\nlike a dullard. He was also taken to be dumb. At the\nsite where the Shambhulingeshvara Temple stands\nat 'Shirali, this boy was placed at the sacred feet of\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        14            May & June 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nAdi Shankara by his worried parents during Acharya's\nsojourn there. Acharya knew in a trice that the boy\nhad the making of a great Teacher. To a simple query\nas to who he was, the so called dumb and dullard boy\nresponded with a hymn, full of Vedantic wisdom.\nAcharya told the parents that the boy will be of no\nuse to them materially, but will be an asset to him\npersonally because he perceived the Truth as clearly\nas the amalaka (avalo in Konkani) on the palm. He\nwas named Hastamalaka.\n   Padmapada was yet another disciple. He was an\nardent bhakta of Lord Narasimha. An episode from\nhis poorvashram days highlights his grit and tenacity\nof purpose. He was pining for a vision of Lord\nNarasimha. He went to the jungle, took his seat and\nresolved never to get up unless he meets Lord\nNarasimha. Forsaking food and water, he stuck to his\nseat. One day, a hunter came to him and enquired\nwhat he was doing. Padmapada replied that he was\ndying to meet Narasimha - half man and half lion.\nThe hunter laughed and said it was not a big problem\nsince the jungle abounded in many weird creatures\nand he would soon return with Narasimha. True to\nhis word, he returned in three days with Narasimha\nbound hand and foot! The hunter was Lord in disguise.\n   This devotion to Narasimha proved to be a blessing\nin later years. Once during his sojourn to the north-\neast, where a number of weird non-Vedic cults\ncommanded a wide following, Acharya had an\nencounter with a Kapalik. Shankara's mission to this\nregion was to win over the people to the Vedic\nmainstream by persuading the wayward to see how\nfar their cults had perverted the pristine teachings.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       15           May & June 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Kapalik said that he performed a Havan every\nyear and needed to offer a nara-bali (human sacrifice)\nto propitiate the Devi. Any human offering will not\ndo: either a king-or a sanyasi is a must. The Kapalik's\nbhakti, though of tamasic variety, impressed Shankara\nand he readily offered himself for the sacrifice. The\nKapalik called on Shankara next day to take him away\nto the sacrificial altar. At that very moment, Padmapada\nwas engaged in his Upasana of Narasimha. He had a\npremonition that something was amiss with regard to\nhis Guru. He was so much tanmaya with Narasimha\nin worship, that he himself assumed Narasimha's form,\npounced upon the Kapalika and tore him to shreds.\n    In these examples from the life of our Acharya we\nfind Gurushakti in action in a gross manner. But, it\nis also the driving force behind all the\nGuruparamparas. On this occasion, we invoke this\nGurushakti to bless us all with inner purity and the\ngift of Poorna Jnana.\n    Revered Swamiji concluded with a bhajan.\n                                   (Tr. V.

Since then, the sacred\ncomplex came to be known as\nSamadhi Math.\nA marble idol of Shri Gopalakrishna\nand later a large idol of Lord\nDattatreya were consecrated herein\nunder the auspices of Parama Pujya\nPandurangashram Swamiji.

The floor was covered with polished granite and the\nwalls covered with marble. The linga was re-installed over the\nSamadhi.

There is a tiger shark in this area this morning!

Since then, the kind turtle always kept a watch over\nthese babies. He knew the area very well and had spotted the\ntiger shark a while ago. He came to warn Sapna and the\nothers.\n\nSapna was aghast. She knew how well protected the puffer\nfish are - thanks to the deadly toxin (tetrodotoxin - to be\nprecise!) in their bodies that could kill almost every type of\nfish and human beings too! But a tiger-shark? Tiger sharks\nand sea snakes were the only ones who were not affected by\nthe poison generated by the puffer fish.\n\"Korpu! Thanks so much!\" said Sapna.\nSapna rushed forward and chirped shrilly, \"Come back, Somu\nand Raj! Danger ahead!\"\nWithin a flash of a second, Sapna found a few rocks- and\nherded all her friends in that direction. She was the last to get\nin and WHOA! Round the corner came the deadly tiger shark!\n\n                                    Sapna immediately puffed up\n                                    and urged the others to do the\n                                    same.

They moan, grunt, croak, boom,\n      hiss, whistle, creak, shriek, and wail. They even rattle\n      their bones and gnash their teeth!  Remember, fish do\n      not have vocal cords!\n\n  *   Fish can form 'schools' containing millions of fish. They\n      use their eyes and something called a 'lateral line' to\n      hold their places in the school. The lateral line is a row of\n      pores running along the fish's sides from head to tail.\n      Special hair in the pores sense changes in water pressure\n      from the movements of other fish or predators.\n\n  *   Lungfish can live out of water for several years. It\n      secretes a mucus cocoon and burrows itself under the\n      unbaked earth.\n\n  *  The biggest fish in the world is the giant whale shark,\n      which can grow to nearly 60 feet! It weighs over 25 tons.\n\n  *  Pufferfish can inflate into a ball shape to evade\n      predators. Also known as blowfish, these clumsy\n      swimmers fill their elastic stomachs with huge amounts\n      of water and blow themselves up to several times their\n      normal size.\n\n  *  Most pufferfish contain a toxic substance that makes\n      them foul tasting and potentially deadly to other fish.\n      The toxin is deadly to humans.\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               48              May & June 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\n*    The slowest fish is a seahorse.

In fact, the city is named after the patron deity.

The word\n\"Mumba\" was derived from the words\n\"Maha'' and \"Amba\", which means \"Great\nMother.\" or  'Maha Shakti\".\n\nIt is believed that the original Mumbadevi\ntemple was built in the 6th century CE and\nlater in Bori Bunder around 1675. The\ntemple was destroyed and reconstructed at\nZaveri Bazaar, Bhuleshwar in the year 1737.\nThe Shrines of Shri Jagadamba, Shri\nAnnapurna and Shri Hanumanji are a part of\nthe Mumbadevi temple complex.

She protects the inhabitants of the village from bandits,\nepidemics, and natural disasters when propitiated. She denotes\nfertility and prosperity and is enshrined within the village\nboundary.\n\n'Mumbaraka', terrorized the pious and hardworking Agri and Koli\nfolk.  So they prayed for respite. Mumbadevi, an eight-armed\nGoddess, was sent by 'Lord Brahma' to vanquish the evil demon.\nAfter his defeat, Mumbaraka fell to his knees and begged\nforgiveness. The Goddess became renowned as the Vanquisher of\nMumbaraka. It is said that Mumbaraka built a beautiful temple\ndedicated to Mumbadevi, which became the heart of Mumbai City\nas she became the Gramadevata.

A semblance of this bliss of the\nAtman is itself reflected through the union of the\nsenses and their objects. Actions in the universe take\nplace under the delusion that the happiness springs\nfrom the objects of sense. According to Yajnyavalkya,\nthe main object of religious rites is the attainment of\nthe bliss of the Atman. Nevertheless, such rites may\nbe abandoned in the condition in which stability of\nmind has been reached, just as the outer husk is\ndiscarded when the inner grain of rice is used as\nfood. But if rice is to be produced, it can be done\nonly with paddy which includes the husk which is\neventually discarded. If the outer husk is thrown\naway at the outset, the rice cannot sprout. Even so,\nif purity of heart, which is essential for a realisation\nof the Atman, is to be achieved, external religious\nrites become helpful.\n    Vasishtha has said that it is generally difficult to\nunderstand how each rite can become the means of\nattaining the goal of man. At the same time, Vyasa\nhas declared that the root of Dharma is to realise\nthat the Paramatman is in all beings.

Hence it is necessary for those who know to\nreform them. So far as we are concerned, we have\nbeen suggesting simplifications in certain directions.\nThere is doubtless need for economy, but consider,\nfor example, the amounts spent on the receptions\naccorded to us and the floral tributes offered to us\nat nearly every step from morn till night.           May not\nsome thought be bestowed on such extravagance?\nOur nature is simple, and we are satisfied with\ndevotion pure and simple.

That is why we are here in B'lore today. You\nhave arranged many programmes of music etc., but\nwhat pleased us most was Kilpady Gurudutt's address\nwherein he spoke on      Sampradaya, March First etc. We\ntoo have never asked anyone to give up what has been\nhanded down by our elders and go entirely modern. As\nGurudutt said, all we have asked is :        do not develop\nthick heads, reflect on what you have heard and\nwhat you are practising. It makes little difference\nwhether you take cow's milk or buffalo milk. Likewise,\nif you are repeating Gayatri Mantra, do not merely\nbe content with the repetition, go deep into the\nmeaning of this Mantra. If we were to        preach Dharma,\npeople would find it difficult in the context of present-\nday conditions. So, we have to devise new ways of\nteaching the people according to their ability to grasp\nand  understand, just as you offer a child a chocolate to\ninduce him to take cough mixture. So, also, first we\nhave to win the confidence of the listeners and then\nconvey to them whatever Dharmik teachings we want to\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         7                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nteach them. That is why, we always say - it doesn't\nmatter if you have many new ideas or go by new paths,\nwhat matters is, with the intelligence given to you by\nGod, how much of our ancient truths you are able to\nimbibe.\n    As we said, Gurudutt spoke of the importance of\nMarch First and stressed the importance of following\nthe Guru. The Vedas tell us that the Guru's feet are\nholy, because they show us the path by which one\nmust tread. But, it is not enough to worship the Guru's\nfeet, you must also follow those feet, you must walk\nby the path by which the Guru's feet have walked\nshowing you the way. That is why the Guru's feet are\nworshipped more than any other part of his sacred\nperson. They are our guides and our pathfinders. That\nis why, We said:     March first. God is there, Guru is\nthere and Sadhana Shakti is also there.       We are moving\nahead and, if you all follow us, you will not be sorry.\n    We do not ask you to accept everything blindly.\nReflect on what we have said, on what the elders\nhave said and accept it only if you firmly believe\nin it. Man is always in search of happiness. In our\naddress at Matunga, we had said that one's Sadhana\nshould not consist only of bookish knowledge read\nand acquired by him. He should also have mental\nSadhana which is the real Sadhana. We should instal\nGod in our mind, think of Him always and worship\nHim in our mind. Nobody is wholly free from the\nentanglements of Sansar. Our elders tell us in the\nscriptures repeatedly \"wake up, wake up.\" When you\nhave to wake up a child in the morning, it is not\nenough to just tell him to wake up, he will not get up.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         8                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nYou have to shake him repeatedly, telling him to wake\nup. Similarly, our scriptures tell us :\n              pevce og:Keb peje og:Keb ce=l3ego&g:Keb Hegve:Hegve: ~\n             mebmeej meeiejs og:Keb lemceeled peeie=efn peeie=efn ~~\nThat is the meaning of the repeated emphasis on\n'peeie=efn peeie=efn\".\n    All of us can attain eternal happiness, but most\nof us do not attain it. Why? It is because our vision\nis veiled by the pall of sorrow. Happiness is of two\nkinds, one is the shadow, the other the substance,\none the unreal and the other the real happiness. We\nare too busy chasing the shadows of happiness in\nour pursuit of wordly pleasures to bother about real\nhappiness. We are seeking happiness outside,\nforgetting its source within us. We have spoken at\nseveral places of the Sport of Brahman, how this\ncreation came into being. The Brahman we refer to\nhere is different from the Brahma of the Trinity\n(Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar). He is the Supreme\nBeing, the Primordial Being. He is without beginning\nand without end, without name or form. That\nSupreme Being felt like having divine Sport-Leela, So\nBrahman created what we might call a split\npersonality, called Adi Shakti. That Shakti deliberated\ndeeply why She was created and realised that\nBrahman wanted to have divine sport and that She\nmust carry out His wishes. So, She, in turn created\nBrahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar and assigned them\nthe three respective functions of creation, preservation\nand destruction. The same Shakti or divine power\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         9                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\npervades all the three functions. The same Shakti\nhas been carrying on this Leela all the while till now\nand will continue to do so in future as well. That is\nwhat the Shastras have always told us, but to explain\nit in simpler terms : a man wakes up, carries on his\ndaily routine and then goes to sleep again at the end\nof the day. These three functions represent creation,\npreservation and destruction and while carrying out\nall the three, the same Shakti works through every\nindividual. So, Shakti is at work in every living\ncreature and all over the world. Such a Shakti can\nbe realised by us in many ways such as Jnana,\nKarma or Bhakti paths. If we look upon Her as the\nDivine Mother and surrender ourselves to Her, placing\nourselves at Her feet, She sheds her veil of Maya and\nreveals Herself to us as Adi Shakti Herself and\nliberates us from the coils of a mortal existence. We\nall have our worldly goals, our mundane aims and\nends and in their pursuit we allow this precious\nhuman life to be frittered away.\n    But, we should realise once and for all that we\nare not here merely to work out the effects of our\npast actions or sow seeds of new actions but to\nrealise the true purpose of our life, namely, to\nliberate ourselves and attain eternal happiness.\nIn other words, we came from Shiva originally\nbut, forgetting this fact, we have become \"Shava\"\nor mortal. We must now go back to our original\nstate in Shiva.\n                   (Summary of the Ashirvachan delivered at\n                                    Bengaluru on 26-1-1976)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        10                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Specially\nthe information that I just gathered in the last 15\nminutes, has reassured me. I have never conducted a\nsession on \"Stress Management,\" I have never\naddressed such an elite gathering of doctors, so believe\nme, I am dealing with stress! But, what has reassured\nme is the inputs that I got. I come to Hubli almost\nevery year, nowadays it is every alternate year for Maha\nShivaratri. The local Saraswats there organize it at\nShiva Krishna Devasthan and it comes out very well.\nWe have the Char Yam Pooja, jagaran, etc. It's a very\npowerful Maha Shivratri, interspersed with sessions\nof deep japa and meditation. And this time I was invited\nhere to Dharwad by the Saraswats and this again I\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam              11                      March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nthink was the first time that I have come here. Lot of\nlove and again surprisingly it is the 75th year of their\nAssociation and the building and they are just stepping\ninto 76th year. So, it was a very good occasion. I don't\nthink it was planned. It turned out to be like that. So,\nagain I will take it as Shiva Sankalpa. Shivam,\nMangalam, an auspicious sankalpa and I feel very\nhappy to be able to participate in such things. And\nthen, I have come here to address you all and I learnt\nthat this place has its own significance. There is a\nwonderful hospital....in itself a very surprising thing\nbecause such hospitals are generally located in more,\nif I may use the word, 'lucrative' areas and here this\nhas been in a place in Dharwad, catering mainly to\nvillagers. I am very impressed with that. And then I\nwas told that this kshetra has that shakti. How many\nacres? 100 acres... You have so many institutions here,\nthe state of the art disciplines, being taught and\npracticed. So, this Kshetra I believe, has that shakti\nand when they checked out with the astrologers, they\nwere told that this tends to attract Mahatmas. That is\nwhy you have a lot of sanyasis, yatis also coming over\nand I am happy because there is some spiritual power\nbehind this, guiding us.\n    Coming to this topic of \"Stress Management,\" I\nthink, Dr. Pai just brought it up, how we understand\n'Stress.' In the early 90s, I was in Rishikesh, at\nKailasashram. Over a 100 years old institution.\nMahatmas of a very high calibre used to gather there\nand there we had photos lining the walls, of the senior\nMahatmas, pontiffs of that place, of that Ashram. Over\na 100 years ago it had begun and there would be the\nyounger sanyasis  who came there or the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         12                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nBrahmacharis. They would be told about the greatness\nof each of the pontiffs. I believe, there was one occasion\n(this was over a 100 years ago). Two Mahatmas were\nin the goshala of the Ashrama, and they were\ndiscussing. The first Swami described his own\nailments, his problems.      keI3ee keAjW [e@keIijpeerkesA Heeme ieS Les Ssmeer oJeeF3eeb oeR\nand the other Mahatma was listening. Now, in that\ngoshala, there were a few labourers who were working,\nhelping out. This first Swami, was describing his\nproblems and he said, \"I was prescribed this medicine\nand subsequently I have been asked to take this\nmedicine.\" At that moment, one of the labourers\nsuddenly said, \"veneR uesvee, cej peeJeesies. So, that Swami was taken\naback. He turned, \"Who is this?\". A person working,\ncleaning up the cow dung here. They called him, they\nfound that he had suddenly appeared in Rishikesh,\nnot speaking much, seeking God, wanting to be\ninitiated into sanyaas and since he had no credentials,\nhe was put through the regular first work in the\ngoshala, to see if he can tolerate it and to understand\nhis intelligence, capacity etc., then his Adhyayana\nstarts and then gradually initiation into sanyas etc.\nSo, these two Swamis were naturally very surprised,\nbecause he spoke very clearly, he explained why that\nmedicine would have been counter-productive to this\nparticular Swami. So, the two Swamis took that man\nto the Abbot, the main Mathadhipati, the Swami there\nand then enquiries were made. They learnt that\noriginally he was a very senior surgeon in Tamilnadu\nand at that time, (I am talking about 100 years ago) he\nwas a Fellow of The Royal Society of Surgeons, very\ndynamic, very competent, with success rate very high;\nand because of that I may say, a little bit of arrogance\nalso. He was very happy with his work and one day he\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         13                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nhad to operate on a patient who was his own sister\nand she couldn't make it, she died there on the\noperation table. That proved too much of a shock and\nhe disappeared. And then they found out, he surfaced\nin Rishikesh, Anonymous, maintained that anonymity\nand at that juncture, well, being doctor at heart, he\ncouldn't bear to see a person taking a wrong medicine\nand he blurted out, he broke his silence. He, what\nshall I say, displayed his knowledge and then he got\ncaught. He was trained; he was accepted, given the\nrespect that was due to him. He was a qualified person\nand the application, the intelligence, the grooming that\nhis intellect had received was very useful for him in\nunderstanding the shastras. How would you\nunderstand this? Because if I am going to talk on\n\"Stress\" I need to know what you mean by \"Stress\".\nWhen we were told this story there, it was like, this is\nsomething glorious. This person, so to say, worldly\nperson, almost an atheist, suddenly discovered there\nis more to this world than himself and his own capacity\nand he made good and he went through the\nshastradyayana, he was respected as a very learned\nMahatma with that strength and peace and love of a\nreal saint at the peak of his career after sanyasa. So,\nhe was kept as some sort of an ideal. And, for us, at\nthat time, it was something exemplary, something not\nto be imitated but something atleast to be admired.\n    There is also a story, nowadays you have a lot of\nthese on Youtube they are circulated. Sometimes it is\nthe audio version also. There's a doctor (it's very\ncontemporary thing)... speaking about a very senior\nsurgeon and he is narrating  in a very good style, very\nprecise. He says, this surgeon, whom he respects a\ngreat deal was explaining something to the younger\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        14                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\ndoctor and he was bursting into tears. Why?... because\nhe had to operate on an eight year old girl and then\njust before the operation began, the girl, that child,\nasked this very senior doctor, the surgeon, a question\nand that baffled him. I am not going to tell you more,\nbecause then it is like giving away the punch line. It's\ngood if you can get to listen that particular audio. Have\nyou heard this? If you have, you can share it with the\nothers. Something happened, something that\ntransformed that senior surgeon. These are the two\nexamples that I can give you. Do you sense stress in\nthis? I didn't. Stress?. There is pressure, there's an\namount of pressure. Any responsibility brings a lot of\npressure on your head. How will you define it as stress?\nStress is when, whatever the structure that is put\nunder pressure, gets deformed and is not able to\nfunction.    That I would identify or define as \"stress\".\nTill then it is okay. You require pressure, you can\nexercise, you can use 50lbs but if you are going to get\na muscle pull out of that, there is stress. It is not\npressure, not the required amount. Isn't it? So, if we\ntry to understand stress, as slightly excessive pressure,\nstill how would you understand this surgeon or that\ngreat surgeon at Kailashashram responding to a\nparticular situation? Did he crumble? Did he crack\nunder stress or was it something extraordinary that\nhappened? We generate stress or rather high degree\nof pressure. Any athlete has to do that which an average\nhuman will consider impossible to sustain. A student\nwho wants to excel will have to put himself under a lot\nof pressure and then he has to take care that he doesn't\nbreak. Isn't it? So we induce that pressure. Without\nbeing judgmental, I would like to say, there was a\ntremendous transformation in the case of that surgeon\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         15                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nfrom Tamilnadu. There was definitely stress, his\nrelatives, his friends; his colleagues may have felt he\nwas broken, etc. I don't know. But he had toughened;\nit was generated through his upasana of medicine, of\nstudy of that particular subject. Because of that, he\ndiscovered that logically he had come to an end of\nwhatever he could understand and if there is something\nbeyond logic, he should get it. That conviction was\nthere, the strength of character was there. He didn't\ncrumble. So, stress brought him to that realization that\nhe cannot be satisfied with, \"I don't see God, so I don't\nbelieve in God.\" That pressure which may be seen or\nperceived as stress actually pushed him into the other\nrealm of shraddha. There with a similar consistent\neffort, persistence, etc. he made the grade again. So,\nfor an average being, it is best to moderate the pressure\non oneself. If you really want to do good, it is better to\ndevelop and take a lot more pressure, so that something\nexcellent can come out of you. Without pressure that\nis not going to happen. Sadhana is that. We have           yama\nthat is our regular rules of conduct in life, and then\nwe have   niyamas also. We take on special disciplines,\nso that what is undetected, the unmanifest strength\nin a person is brought out. If it is done intelligently, it\ncomes out well. If it is not attended to, if there is lack\nof understanding and intelligence, lack of shraddha\nalso, then it can become \"stress.\" So, to understand,\nto deal with it a fair amount of intelligence is required\nbefore we go on to any practicality, techniques of\nhandling stress. A 23 years old, healthy otherwise,\nsuddenly develops diabetes. Haven't we heard of it?\nNow it is very common. Why? Because of stress. Gone\nto the US, got a study Visa, they have to make their\ngrade in that much time, so they sacrifice their health.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam          16                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nNow, isn't this lack of intelligence? A 22 year old, 23\nyear old, landing up with such problems. And there is\nenough intelligence to understand that the body is let\ndown by not giving it the necessary exercise. So,\nintelligence is the first thing. There's a body intelligence,\nwhich will demand of you that it requires exercise.\nThere is a social intelligence which you have to\ncultivate, so that you understand where the pressure\nis getting into the zone of stress. You cannot be\nmonitored every time. So, that is what we try to do\nthrough spiritual sadhana. Develop the sensitivity\nwithin and without. And if it is not there, then\neverything can become stress. Mathadhipatya can be\nvery, very stressful. Yeah! And believe me, the first few\nyears were very hectic. From metropolitan cities etc\npeople used to come, I had to meet them, listen to\ntheir joys and sorrows, share, help them out, but it\nwould prove to be very stressful. So, on one occasion,\nI remember I had to meet quite a few families one after\nthe other. I was tired, I could barely speak. This couple,\na 50 odd year old couple, they came, they met me,\nthey were very happy and then they said, \"Swamiji\ncan you give us 10 mins, tomorrow?\" I said, \"Why? I\nhave given you prime time, so to say, a Saturday and\nagain?\" \"No, we would like to bring our children.\" I\nwas so irritated. These people don't seem to have any\nconsideration at all. I am  also tired, that must have\nexpressed through my expression, even if I didn't say\nit verbally. They left and I forgot about it. And next\nmorning they were there. They accosted my Secreary\nand said, \"We had asked Swamiji and we are going to\nmeet Him. Swamiji appeared to say 'Yes' at that time\nso we have brought our children also.\" And I was a\nlittle busy, so I had to come down to meet them. I was\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         17                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nstressed out, not at all happy with the undue pressure.\nThey peeped in and came in with their children, 15\nyear old boys and they had to carry those two boys. I\ndon't know, they were just sort of limbo. I really don't\nknow the technical term for it. But they were full grown\nboys and they were not able to move, they were just in\nthat state, and that's the way they were. For 15 years\nthese parents, have taken care of those boys. It was\nan eye opener for me. I expected some young\nadolescents being brought there against their will to\nsee Swamiji, namaskar karo, and all that. I had not\nbeen able to detect my unhappiness or anything on\ntheir faces when I met them the previous day. They\nwere so happy, they seemed to content and they had\nbrought those children also...real Bhakti. I was put to\nshame. So, where is \"stress?\" That very moment that\nstress left me. Somehow I didn't have the capacity or\nthe guts to say, I am under stress because of\nMathadhipatya. These parents could tolerate that, they\nnever even complained. I am blessed with so much,\nthe entire Parampara and Lord Bhavanishankara, how\ndare I complain? So, even an understanding can take\nthe cuttings off your stress and put you under pressure\nwhich you can handle intelligently. That demands that\nyou be a little sensitive. If you think of yourself, you\nare going to get stressed out.  You think you are the\ncenter of the world, that everybody should take care of\nyou. Now, once that idea goes off, your spiritual\nsadhana begins. I am a very important component, I\ncan't deny myself, but I belong to something great.\nNow connected to that, I can be very efficient, I can do\nsomething beautiful, if I disconnect I try to make myself\nimportant, then it is me and the world on the other\nside. Let's decide who's heavier and there you are lost\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         18                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nand you get stressed out.     So, connecting to the Divine\nis the only way out of \"Stress,\" There will be I don't\nknow, a new term, a paradigm shift or whatever, that\nis also necessary. A huge amount of stress is required.\nIsn't it so? You put up a lot of resistance, you make\nyour efforts and you orbit around the Earth, but to go\nahead beyond the Gravitational pull of the Planet, you\nrequire some extra strength. Isn't it? That releases you,\nit doesn't bind you. There is that sort of stress also.\nBut that stress, which is what was experienced by the\nsurgeon I just mentioned in the first context, it sent\nhim from the intellectual, from a very qualified stage\nof a very senior surgeon, into the realms of the spiritual.\nHe didn't lose his way. Because he was very good at\nwhat he was doing, because he had a lot of respect for\nhimself, for his art, or for his science, he could make\nthe grade in the next run. A person who is feeble and\nstill struggling with whatever he is stuck, cannot aspire\nfor a higher level of understanding. We bring, we induce\npressure to bring that strength out, and it is the Divine\nwhich steps in to give the necessary push which we\ncan say \"stress\" to launch you into the next level. Please\nunderstand, there is an unintelligent stress, absolutely\nunintelligent, where a person cannot take care of his\nbody. There is an unconscious stress, where external\nhealth requires a certain amount of counseling, some\npsychiatrist may have to examine and even given some\nmedicines to maintain the chemical balance of the\nbrain....that is also required, there's nothing wrong in\nthat. It seems to be taboo in our samaj. No, just as\nyou can have a stomach disorder, there may be times\nwhen a little balancing act has to be done by a\nProfessional, a trained groomed Professionals. That\nagain will help you take care of stress, because you\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam          19                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nare not getting things right. All these things are\navailable and then you have techniques like Pranayam\netc. So, the health you maintain, what you call stress\nlevels etc., don't get into the danger zone. But the\nunexpected always happens, life is not as you have\nalways planned it out. So if you are good at what you\nare doing, you are able to bring about some sort of\npressure in your life, some discipline in your life where\nyou don't feel you are just drifting, there is purpose to\nlife. 24 hours, how do you spend it? You are applying\nwhatever your capacities are for your own development,\nfor your samaj, etc. It's a fulfilling life. Those pressures\nyou have brought on yourself, you are accepting. That\nsort of a life will prepare you to make life intelligent\nand also help you when the push comes for the launch\nand you won't succumb to the unintelligent stress.\n    Exercise is the very basic thing that is required.\nBecause of the sophistication, because of our attempt\nat making life more comfortable and fast, we are losing\nout on it a lot. No condemnation, that is the way, it's\ngoing on. So, you have to have time kept aside for the\nbody, Breathing is again very, very important, the\ncorrect type of breathing. There is regular Pranayam,\nthere are also techniques that can be practiced and\nthese are important. I see them from the spiritual\ncontext also. We have a time kept for japa, for pooja,\netc., and at that time we don't want any disturbance,\nwe don't want mundane to infiltrate there. I don't want\nto think about anybody, I only want to be with God\nand I have demarcated some time for that preferably\nmorning or something like that. That is good. But\nduring the day, because of the energy that I have\ngenerated in those one hour or two hours or whatever,\nduring the day also I am not going to further segregate\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         20                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nand say, \" Now I don't want to think of God when I am\nworking.\" The thinking of God, when I am working is\ncalled Anusmaran. This is one of the best ways of\ndealing with stress. Anusmaran is a technical term, it\nhas to be understood, otherwise you can again get into\ntrouble.\n    Smaran is recollection, memory. What is\nAnusmaran? When I am confronted by an event or I\nhave to act, if I have the capacity to do the smaran of\nwhat I have revered, what I have invoked in my better\nmoments so to say, that is going to give me the capacity\nto deal with this moment intelligently, So, when\nsomebody is preparing, somebody is doing something\nGmeer mece3e YeieJeevekeAe ef(r)ebleve keAjvee doesn't mean you shut your eyes\nand try to think of God or do you japa. It won't work\nout. Anusmaran permits you to see, experience through\nyour sense. At the same time that feebleness of the\nheart, that panicking or confusion which a jiva can\nexperience is replaced simply by allowing the Divine\nto step in. \"In Your presence I am dealing with this.\"\nThat is Anusmaran, it has to be practiced, it is a kala\nand it works. But, of course, you have to have some\ntime kept aside for that when you say, you really deal\nwith God as you understand Him, and for that, japa,\netc. are the very basic practices. They are accepted in\nall the religious, spiritual, literature and sadhanas all\nover the world. So, when you want to sit for japa, you\nstart with the body, be gentle with your body,\nunderstand, there are some techniques, sitting straight\netc. If you are not very comfortable, with some\nbackache or something, then just roll this up, perch\nyourself a little higher, that releases the strain, you\nfeel good. In the spiritual, you always go from the gross\nto the subtle, from the subtler to subtlest. So, you start\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         21                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nwith the gross, if you feel the stress here, release it,\ngently bend the body, very, very simple exercises, not\nnecessarily yogic postures. In the process, be aware of\nwhat is happening to your body, because there is no\nend result, the very movement is very soothing, it is\nrelaxing the muscles, stretching, few techniques like\nthat. And after that you are going to the breathing.\n    So, this is what I would like to share with you.\nThere are techniques that can be practiced. There are\ntechniques we have it in our yoga etc.,  which have\nbeen rediscovered by your medicine..Jacobson's\nrelaxation technique is one. Isn't it? People when they\nare going to appear for an interview or even if there is\nBoard Meeting, there's lot of anxiety, it is just\nrecommended that, since they are sitting at a table,\ntheir legs etc., are not visible, tense some of the muscles\nlike the thigh muscles intensely for a few seconds and\nthen release them. It sets off a reaction which cools\ndown the body. It is known as the Jackobson's\ntechnique, I learnt, because it was a part of the yoga\nstudy that I was doing. Very interesting..... The nervous\nanxiety etc., just subsides. From the physical, you are\ntackling the mental. What a wonderful thing. These\nare all techniques. But the basic intelligence should\nbe there. In my life, I will bring about a discipline which\nwill make my life worthy, meaningful, I'll be able to\ndetect unintelligent stress, I will deal with it. And if I\ncan connect to the Divine, that Anusmaran is going to\nhelp me immensely. Life will be purposeful, I'll never\nbe isolated, segregated, I'll feel the joy of the wholeness,\nof which I am a very valuable part. This belonging to\nthe Divine...if that can be understood, if that can be\ninculcated, it is wonderful.\n    This is a good institution, excellent work being done\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam          22                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nhere, I am proud to be part of this, I am proud to belong\nto this. That gives a tremendous satisfaction to people\nhere, isn't it? The same thing if we connect to the\nDivine, I am proud to belong to this Ishwara, this\nTatva...Ha! So much more joy. This is what we are\ngoing to give these young Doctors here. I am sure you\nare training them to be good Doctors, you are setting\nvery high standards where in this difficult world, you\nare teaching them some ethical values, with your own\nexperience, with your own example you are setting a\nhigh standard for them, I am very proud of that. And\nthis kshetra itself is bringing to you good people and\nhelping you retain the good people as you just\nmentioned, it's a tremendous thing, it's a very secure\nenvironment. In this Institution may good work happen\nwhere you teach them how to excel, where you teach\nthem how to discover what is pressure, necessary\npressure, what is intelligent stress, how to deal with it\nand ultimately get in touch with the Divine which is\nvery much within one's own self. So, your motivation\netc., comes from that. This is our goal, it is called,\n\"Nimitta matram bhava savyasachin...\". Arjuna was\ntold to become a      nimitta, I work through you.\" But,\nremember, Arjuna was addressed as Savya sachin in\nthat context. He was not called Arjuna. \"Savya sachin,\"\nis a person who is ambidextrous, who could hold his\nbow in his left hand and right hand and shoot equally\nwell. He had mastered the art. So, we have to master\nsomething, we have to understand overselves. Then\nthe Divine begins to flow through us, work through us\nand there is the joy. There's an immense responsibility\non you, I don't want you all to be stressed out, I want\nyou to give to the younger generation the much needed\ndirection. Let them receive that, let them benefit and\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         23                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nlet them benefit the samaj at large, not only as\npractitioners of the medical science, but also as human\nbeings who have understood, who have developed the\nintelligence and the sensitivity to understand other\npeople's suffering and help then out. May this happen\nfrom this     kshetra, this      kshetra mahima. This is the\nPrayer I offer at the Feet of Lord Bhavanishankar.\n    I am very happy I could meet all of you.

If he fails to perform his\nduty in a proper manner, he will be committing a sin.\n    The most responsible among such duties is that of\ndispensing justice. When a person is engaged in that\ntask no other consideration should obstruct justice.\nMore explicitly, when one is judging a matter, one\nshould not be swayed by pecuniary or other\nconsiderations for oneself into misinterpreting justice.\n    In a like manner, one should not allow personal\ngrudge to alter the course of justice.\n    In the Mahabharata, when Dharmaraja lost the game\nof dice due to Shakuni's cunningness, Draupadi raised\na question in the Kauravas' court: Was the ignominy of\nDharmaraja in accord with justice? Though there were\nmany knowledgeable persons in the court, they hesitated\nto speak out, fearing Duryodhana's wrath.\n    Such a situation should not occur.

The core of the matter is the\nDivine without beginning and end. We studied that\nprinciple of Divinity as the united       prasada of the\nGuru and the    Deva.\n   The whole work of       Shvetashvatara ends on the\nfinal note of prasada.   Shvetashvatara Rishi has given\nus this eternal legacy, this wealth of wisdom he earned\nthrough the proper channel of traditions to be\ninherited now by us. Just as        Rishi Shvetashvatara\ngot this knowledge of the    Brahman, so will others get\nit in the same way. So both       prabhava and     prasada\nhave to be always borne, acquired and exercised.\nPrabhava of sadhana has something to do with us\npersonally and      prasada manifests in the Lord\naccordingly and in response to it, as it were. The\nsoul shall execute its duty and the Lord shall also\nexecute His. But it is not actually His duty, it is His\nnature.\n   Prasannata, clarity, stillness, satiation, peace --\nall these ideas go to crystallise the word       'prasada.'\nGita says: \"That which puts an end to all sorrow is\nprasada.\" This    prasada can be given only by the\nDeva, the Being of all beings. Therefore, towards the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       26                 March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nend of the   Gita, the Lord says: \"You surrender your\nall and I shall free you from the sorrow.\"\nViniyoga\n   Shvetashvatara Rishi goes on to say in the first\nhalf of the fourth    mantra: \"Having initiated oneself\ninto the  tatkarma, one should complete the Activity\nby pouring into it all the      bhava, all the emotional\nmovements of the heart. And this should be a\n'viniyoga', a very discrete harmonious Offering\naccording to the     guna of one's own nature. \"Here,\none is expected to blend with the acts of duty, one's\nemotions and let them flow to God, their rightful\nsource and their ultimate goal. This        viniyoga makes\nsadhana an emotional fulfilment. This is the path of\nBhakti.\n   The fifth   mantra says, take to that       Deva who is\nestablished in the heart of seeker. Try to experience\nhim as the primordial cause of all connections and\nhappenings. The path of            Bhakti is a gradual\nunravelling of the   Devatattva through the awakening\nof all facets of  bhava.\nBhakti Yoga\n   The   Shvetashvatara gives the clue to the          bhakti\nyoga  in Bhagavat Gita. \"Only through       Bhakti can I be\nknown truly as I am and in my entirety. Having\nrealised my essential nature, the devotee enters into\nme forthwith.\"\n   Astonishingly, all religions or philosophies\navowedly pledge themselves to Truth, Fullness and\nundiluted Bliss, the same       Satchidananda sought by\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        27                 March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nall beings.\n    As it is a very popular pathway,       Bhakti-yoga runs\nthe risk of being diluted to mere sentimentality. But\nthen, if we try to eliminate it as a weakness of the\nmind, instead of sentimentality, we will have sterility\nofsadhana, which is even more dangerous. Therefore,\nto string  sadhana to the correct pitch and derive the\nrichness of spirituality,        Bhakti yoga has to be\nunderstood properly.\n    \"Bhakti is love, that movement of the soul towards\namritatva, sweetness.\" The experience of this\nsweetness manifests as love.       Bhakti is the flowing of\nthe soul towards the adorable sweetness; and that\nsweetness must be your own soul.\n    Various things are experienced as \"lovely\"; what\nis common between them? The            Rishi say: It is you.\nYou give your    atmiyata to something and allow it to\nbe expressed or reflected by that thing. Whenever\nand wherever it happens, you experience love. Your\nself-awareness gives it a permanent base. Just as\nsweetness is established, not in       laddu, but in sugar,\neven so all emotions of joy derive their essence not\nfrom things, but from soulfulness.\n    The soul is hungering for the ultimate in love, for\nthe ultimate in knowledge.         Vairagya is needed to\nrecognise this fact. We have already seen that        vairagya\nis not a negative force but something that helps you\nto uplift life to a spiritual level. Having realised this,\nthe  sadhaka avoids these mis-experiments and\ndedicates himself to the proper path of love. As the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        28                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nUpanishad says:     'Vijnanam Anandam Brahma'. He is\nthe source of all true knowledge and undiluted bliss,\nthe two main things that form the basis of life's\nsearch.\n                     Ishvara in     Guru\n    Having grasped the concept of the           Guru, as we\nhave already seen, now you must gaze into that\nconcept; because     Guru is the mirror of God. You see\na face appearing in it, and this face flashing in the\nheart of the   Guru is    Ishvara until the mirror called\nGuru comes in front of you.\n    Vedanta holds: \"By God's grace alone man can\nget an idea of    advaita.\"   Advaita cannot be given to\nyou. But to make you realise the        advaita in you, you\nneed an idea or sense of it. It is something which\nnone can give. But the Lord creates this              advaita-\nvasana through his own inscrutable power of\nbenediction. This benediction will be valid only if the\nsoul is steeped in   Ishvara bhakti. If   jnana is cognition,\nbhakti is the condition for that, a sort of pre-cognition.\nBhakti is the \"sense of seeing\", the        divya-vasana.\n    Scriptures talk about three main categories of\nbhakti: The   prakrita,  the  madhyama      and the    para  or\nuttama. The first is an ordinary crude form of         bhakti,\nthe second is a cultured one and the third is superfine\nand divine. We may consider them as three stages of\nbhakti a   sadhaka has to pass through.\n                                                  (Continued)\n            (Courtesy : Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt.

Rajagopal Bhat\n\n    Shivaratri - The Night of  Shiva - occurs every\nmonth. The 14th tithi of KrishNa Paksha in every\nmonth is called as Shivaratri. It is called Masa           (ceeme)\nShivaratri,but, the Shivaratri in the month of Magha\nis called Maha Shivaratri - the Major (maha) Shivaratri,\nthe others being Minor. MahaShivaratri is a Vrata;\nindeed, it is called as Vrata Raja (Prince among the\nVratas). Its observance is said to be more meritorious\nthan all the sacrifices.   (efMeJejeef$eefjefle K3eelee meJe& 3e%eesEeceesEecee).\n    MahaShivaratri  is quite unlike our other festivals.\nThere is no gaiety, no revelry, no undue stress on\ndecorations. There is an austere air about it. Fast rather\nthan Feast is its hallmark and this is natural because\nour beloved Lord BhavaniShankar is the embodiment\nof Vairagya and Tyaga - dispassion and renunciation.\nHe is the darling deity of all ascetics. In Karnataka it\nis also called 'the festival of fast'                 .\n    There are various stories about MahaShivaratri\nstrewn in various PuraNas. Some say it was on this\nnight that Shiva appeared as the endless Column of\nLight before Brahma and VishNu who were furiously\narguing as to who among them was  superior. Some\nsay Shiva's TaNDava dance took place on this night. A\nfew legends associate MahaaShivaraatri with Shiva\ngulping down the Halahala poison, a deadly by-product\nof Samudra Mathana, thereby becoming NeelakaNtha.\n    A popular story about the enormous merit of\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         33                   March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nadoring Shiva on MahaShivaratri  revolves around a\nhunter. Disappointed at not getting any prey, he was\nperched on the branch of a Bilva tree and was  hopeful\nsome deer or any other prey may be sighted at night.\nWhen he was  so parked precariously, UNKNOWINGLY\nworship took place at his hands! There was a Shivalinga\nat the base of the tree. When he was shuffling leaves\nto spot a prey, bilva leaves fell down from time to time\non the Shivalinga. When he was drinking water from\nhis leather pouch, water used to trickle down on the\nShivalinga. He stayed awake overnight, hoping against\nhope,that he would catch a prey. Most important, he\nobserved fast during day and night. Thus,\nUNKNOWINGLY, he complied with the mandatory\nrequirements of the Vrata like keeping vigil (jagaraNa),\nfast (during day and night), abhisheka and bilvapatra\nsamarpaNa. The story goes that the emissaries of Shiva\nlanded there with a chartered Vimaana and took him\naway to Kailasa. If UNKNOWINGLY so much merit is\ngained, what to say of the reward that is in store for us\nif we observe MahaShivaratri  KNOWINGLY! This is\nthe message of this story.\n    The sages say that MahaShivaratri is unlike any\nother night. The air is said to be dense with very\npowerful spiritual vibrations       (mHebove) on this night  and\nwe stand to gain immensely if we comply with the four\nstipulations -    peeiejCe, GHeJeeme, DeefYe<esJeA andefyeuJeHe$e meceHe&Ce -\nand worship Shiva.

Silent meditation is another\nstaple of the   meeOevee. Upavasa signifies not just skipping\na meal, but, resting    (Jeeme) ourselves heart and soul near\n(GHe) God. It is a prayerful proximity (sannikarsha) to\nGod that constitutes Upavasa.\n    During rest of the year, most of us are not so\naustere; so, the MahaShivaratri comes annually to\nawaken us and  compensate as it were.\n    Normally,    mebmeej is visualised as night, the dark night\nof ignorance and of I and mine. This night should be\nturned into a Good and Auspicious (Shiva) Night               (efMeJe\njeef$e) and that can happen only when we welcome Shiva\ninto our lives.

Rajagopal Bhat\n\n    HOLI is a very popular festival all over India, marked\nby lot of gaiety, noisy revelry and fun. It has various\nnames other than Holi such as Holika, Holikotsava,\nPhalgunika and Vasantotsava. In Karnataka it is also\ncalled as Kamana Habba. This festival falls on\nPhalguNa PoorNima. In West Bengal it has rather a\ndifferent complexion altogether and is called Dol-\nPoorNima or Dol-Yatra (    oesue 3ee$ee) or Festival of the Swing.\nThere is no bonfire here. Image of KrishNa is placed\non the swing and is swung at least 21 times\naccompanied by chants of KrishNa's name. Dolyatra\nis said to have been started by King Indradyumna in\nBrindavan. The great saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was\nborn on this day.\n    There are at least three legends associated with\nHoli:\n    1. It was on this day that Lord Shiva opened His\nthird eye and reduced Cupid (          JeAece) to ash (JeAeceonve)\nbecause his pranks were disturbing Shiva who was\nlost in deep meditation.\n    2. Prahlad's paternal aunt - HiraNyakashipu's sister\n- was Holika. She had received a boon that made her\nimmune to even blazing fire. The wicked\nHiraNyakashipu had tried in vain to kill his own child,\nPrahlada, because he was devoted to Lord VishNu,\narch-enemy of demons. The evil-minded father asked\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        36                  March 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nhis sister Holika to enter the blazing  fire with Prahlada\non her lap. He thought she will come out unscathed\nand Prahlad would die. Thanks to VishNu's grace, the\nchild Prahlada came out of the pyre, chanting the\nnames of  VishNu and the demoness Holika was\nreduced to ash. The fire lit on Holi night is a dramatic\nreplay of this legend. Coconuts are consigned to the\nfire along with assorted pieces of wood. Leftover\npartially burnt pieces of the coconuts are distributed\nas Prasad.\n    3. A demoness called  DhuNDa (          {gb{e) had become a\nscourge of the children. She used to pursue children\nat play and kill them. Certain boons confered on her\nhad made her invincible. Moved by the plight of\nchildren whom she was tormenting, Lord Shiva cursed\nher that she would die when children follow her loudly\nshouting and showering her with abuses. She thus\nmet her end in this curious manner. This explains the\nassociation of this festival even now  with noise, shouts,\nbawdy jokes and even abuses  etc in certain sections\nof the society. Indeed, there is a scriptural sanction\nfor such a  bizarre behaviour.

Children\nand youngsters and, in some States, even grownup\nmen and women, throw coloured powder and water\non each other as if in imitation of the frolics of KrishNa\nand the Gopikas in Brindavan in the days of yore.\n    What is the spiritual message of this festival? The\ndemonesses Holika and DhuNDha represent all that\nis negative and pernicious in us.  They should go up in\nflames, making way for joy and laughter in our lives.\nThis is what the bonfire stands for.\n    Kama, per se, (by itself), is not an evil.

They  included  in  it  certain\nadditional items which they thought to be worthwhile\nfrom the laymen's point of view, and sent it back to\nus  for  approval.  The  additional  items  which  they\nsuggested included our benedictory speeches both\nin the morning and evening today.

Moreover,\nas there is no scope for individual Padapujas today,\na suggestion has been received to allow opportunity\nto visitors from the mofussil who intend to leave the\ncity tomorrow, at least to offer their Kanik before\nthey go. So, they will have to be allowed to do so\nbefore distribution of light refreshments.

Naturally, we ought to\nhave invited to this function the Gowd Saraswat\ndisciples of Kaivalya, Kashi and Gokarn Maths. But\nthe very reason, namely want of accommodation,\nlack of other facilities for a large congregation, etc.\nwhich necessitated the selection of the city of Bombay\nin preference of Shirali (Chitrapur), ideally suited\nfor such a ceremony, made us abandon the idea of\ninviting them on this occasion.\n   Moreover, we thought that by inviting the heads\nof their Maths and proffering to them all proper\nhonour, we would be honouring their respective\nfollowers also; and accordingly, we decided to extend\ninvitations to those Dharmagurus. The head of\nKaivalya Math being now in Khanapur, could not be\ninvited. But an invitation was sent to the head of the\nKashi Math as he was in Bombay a few days ago. It\nwas also sent to the head of Gokarn Math on the\nexpectation that he would come to Bombay by now.\nRnt din to the nreRsenre of the devotees, still in\nBelgaum. The head of the Kashi Math having arrived\nthis morning in Bombay, we expect that he would\ngrace the function here in the evening. In short, the\nonly reason for our not inviting the Gowd Saraswat\npublic for the occasion was want of accommodation,\nand we hope that people will not think otherwise.\n   Another point which needs clarification is that\nan occasion like this should have had its fitting\nconsummation (Mangala) by way of a feast\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        8              November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\n(Santarpana). But, as it was not a practical proposition\nin a big city like Bombay, the members of the\nStanding Committee had intended to distribute\nsweets only as Prasad. We, however, suggested that\nat least light refreshments should be served. Though\nthey were afraid that it might prove rather an\nimpossible task to carry through, they have\nundertaken responsibility of distributing light\nrefreshments by reason of our pressure. Therefore,\nin view of the fact that the members of the Standing\nCommittee on whom the task devolves are your own\nrepresentatives, and as this is arranged on behalf of\nthe Math which is your own home, we wish that you\nwould all overlook such defects and shortcomings as\nmay occur in carrying it out.\n   Before the establishment of our Samsthan (Math),\nthe leaders of our community were mostly under\nthe patronage of the Nagar Kingdom. The people of\nthose times were under the impression that only\nmembers of the community who had Dharmagurus\nof their own were leading virtuous lives, while those\nwho had no such religious heads were undisciplined\nin their ways of life. It is generally held that the\nabsence of separate Dharmaguru for our community\nwas hindering the recognition of our people from\ntheir legitimate status, and that it was mainly for\nthis political reason that our people strove to establish\na Dharma-peetha. The conditions have now changed.\nViewed from the political aspect, there now seems to\nbe no need for a Dharma-peetha. It is observed in\nthese days that there is ample State protection and\nrecognition for all except those who come under the\ncategory of Brahmins! But, it does not appear that\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        9              November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nour people got the Dharma-peetha established merely\nfor political reasons. Past records reveal that our\npeople were inspired by devoted attachment (Nishtha)\nto Dharma, and they established the Dharma-peetha\n(Math) as being necessary for the spiritual way of\nthought and act. Moreover, tradition has it that even\nbefore the establishment of this separate Math for\nthemselves, our people in South Kanara were\nattached to the Pejawar Math (one of the eight Maths\nof Udipi), and those In North Kanara to Kaivalya\nMath.\n    The Shruti says, \"Dharma is the prop of the\nwhole universe; and people go to the man of religion\nto obtain his grace and wisdom. By practice of\nDharma, the man of religion wards off sin. Dharma\nis the foundation of all happiness (both material and\nspiritual). Dharma is, therefore, said to be the greatest\n(the most pre-eminent)\". The Smriti says, \" Dharma\nis so called because it upholds people. It is an\nestablished conclusion (Siddhanta) that, only that\nwhich is equipped with the quality of upholding, is\nDharma.\" Dharma consists of two parts, namely\nPravritti (active) and Nivritti (tranquil or restful). The\nPravritti-Dharma while yielding prosperity to the\nindividual also gives peace and welfare to society\nand sustains it. The Nivritti Dharma secures for the\njeeva the attainment of the Supreme Goal of Eternal\nJoy, which is really its original Atma-Swarupa; and\nit also keeps him secure in this high state and\nprevents his decline. And the prevention of such a\ndecline is also a sort of upholding (Dharma). Thus,\nby this quality of upholding, the word \"Dharma\"\napplies to both Pravritti and Nivritti Dharma.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         10              November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nSince material prosperity and spiritual peace\nand happiness which are obtainable from Dharma,\nare things worth seeking for by people at all times,\nit may well be said that there is a need for such\na Dharrna and Dharma-peethas for ever. It is for\nthis reason that this function of Shishya Sweekar\nhas been performed to keep the Math going in the\nfuture for ever and ever, according to the wishes\nof the disciples.\n   May the Paramatman vouchsafe to this Shishya\na long life, sound health, a keen intellect and deep\nwisdom, and may the disciples continue to get the\nbenefits of the Math through him for ever, -- this\nis our prayer at His Feet on this auspicious\noccasion.

This single\nsyllabled sacred word has been uniformly upheld in\nVedic literature as the nearest approximation to a\nsound symbol of Brahman, the highest truth. Texts,\nlike the Mandukya Upanishad, are exclusively\ndedicated to the exposition of the Omkara as an\nunfailing means to Self-knowledge. According to these\ntexts everything emanated from Om : all that is, was\nand shall be. Om also indicated that truth which\ntranscends these triple measurements of time. The\nintrinsic structure of this syllable, as the sadhaka\nmeditates on it, unravels the entire gamut of creation,\nsustenance and dissolution of the universe. It also joins\nthe individual awareness to the universal. Ultimately,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         23             November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nwhen an aspirant is established in the total effect of\nOmkara-upasana, it completely obliterates the\napparent reality of all duality, giving rise to the pure,\nnon-dual awareness that knows no beginning and end.\nThis is called Prapanchopashama and Shiva. This\nobliteration is expressed through the use of the word\nSimha in the first name.\n    Omkara is the Simha, the Lion. The Lion is called\nPanchanana, the one with the wide mouth, it devours\neverything. Therefore Omkara which has the\nPrapancha in its mouth is likened to a lion.\n    Secondly, as the roar of the lion silences the sound\nof all other animals, the utterance of Om removes the\nrestlessness of the mind. The lion is Mrugendra, the\nking of the forest beasts. Omkara is Sarvendra, the\nLord of all creation, the Ishvara.\n    This word can also be interpreted to mean that\nOmkara is the lion-like carrier, on which the universal\nawareness comes riding. The word Dakshinamurti\nitself implies the universal awareness that is perceived\nthrough a particualr state of mind, Brahmakara Vritti,\nwhich is called Dakshin.a or Shemushi (that which\nhides everything).\n    Omkara has the power to induce the Brahmakara\nVritti, in which the Brahman is experienced.\n    The various aspects of Omkara Upasana, and\ndifferent subtle shades of its connections with\nBrahman, are artistically brought forth in this set of\nfour names, with four different analogies. The effect\nis best realised by studying them together.\n    In the second name, Omkara is the udydna - the\npleasure garden in which the Lord is Kokila (cuckoo).\nIn the third, Omkara is compared to a nest for\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        24              November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nDakshinamurthi, the parrot. In the last name, the\nOmkara is a veritable wilderness in which wanders\nthe great tusker, Sri Dakshinamurthi. it is to be noted\nthat the garden is created by constant care and\ntending, where as the forest grows by itself. The former\nhas its own cultured charm and the latter its wild\nbeauty. In these two aspects of upasana, the Lord's\nmanifestations are different - one speaks of His\nsweetness and the other is His majestic power.\n    The analogy of the parrot obviously conveys a sense\nof swift colourful flight. The parrot does not build its\nnest but takes abode in a natural hole in the tree trunk.\nOmkara is like that little space in which the Self has\nits rest and from which it takes off its mystic flight.\n    One may perceive, in the last three names, the\nshabda, rupa and kriya aspects of truth-manifestation.\nThe Omkara also appears in different aspects, as a\nspiritual culture, a natural word-symbol and a vast\ndimension of creativity.\n    5) veiejepemegleepeeefve : - Nagaraja - sutajanih\n    The Lord of the daughter of mountains\n    6) veiejepeefvepeeue3e: - Nagaraja - nijalayah\n    He who is housed in the Himalayas.\n    Shiva is inextricably connected with the\nHimalayas, the God-like manifestation standing at the\nNorthernmost frontiers of this land of Bharata. To\nDakshinamurthi, who is ever envisaged in the\nNorthern direction, there can be no more fitting abode.\nWe have always looked to the Himalayas, for spiritual\ninspirations and sustenance of savik life. Apart from\nthis geographical and historical fact, the king of\nmountains (Nagaraja) symbolizes the psychic\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         25              November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nexcellence in the human being. While identifying the\nuniversal pattern within the human body we are asked\nto look upon the bones as mountain ranges. The most\nimportant of them, is the back bone. Within the spinal\ncord is the sushumna nadi, the subtle path, through\nwhich the mind is led towards ultimate illumination\nand liberation. The Brahma Vidya, so achieved is\nlikened to Parvati    (veiejepemeglee) born of the Himalayas.\n    `Naga' means the one who does not move. The best\nway of being the unmoved, is to be the all-pervading\nspace, which has nowhere to go; this is the Nagaraja.\nDakshinamurti has his svarupa residing in this all -\npervading nature of truth.\n    7) veJeceeefCekeI3e ceeuee{ie: Navamanikya - maladhyah\n    Adorned with necklaces of precious gems.\n    Manikya is the name of ruby. The Lord's divine\nform is bedecked with freshly cut         (veJe) rubies, whose\ngleaming red colour sets off to good effect, the white\nlustre of Shiva's frame. These ornaments symbolise\ndivine powers, siddhis or aishwaryas :\n    The word 'Nava' may also mean the digit nine. In\nthat case, manikya stands for not only ruby but all\nprecious gems, of which nine are considered most\neminent. The nine gems          (veJejlve) here may stand for\nthe well-known Ashtha siddhis of Hatha Yoga, along\nwith the higher spiritual achievement of Sarvatma\nBhava which is the ninth (See the 10th verse of Sri\nDakshinamurti Stotra).\n    8) veJe(r)eveefMeKeeceefCe: Navachandrashikharnanih\n    He who has the second digit of the moon as his\n    diadem.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         26              November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nMythologically this refers to the Moon-god being\ncursed with the deadly disease of consumption, for a\nsin he committed. To be saved from it, Chandradeva\nperformed penance to propitiate Lord Shiva at the holy\nPrabhasa Tirtha. Lord Ashutosha redeemed the\nrepentant devotee, accepting him as his head-\nornament, so that the divine touch could rejuvenate\nthe moon every time he was about to be totally\nextinguished by the curse. That is how the waxing\nand waning of the moon is interpreted by this story,\nrevealing the efficacy of true penitence and penance\nof the devotee and the mercifulness of the Lord.\n    Placed amongst a number of names indicating\nupsurge of spiritual power, this name may aptly be\ntaken to indicate the blossoming of new         (veJe) spiritual\ntalents that manifest the joy of the soul. The word\nChandra means one who gives joy. Nava-chandra,\ncould also mean fresh or ever-new joy. Dakshinamurti\nis that full enlightenment on whose crest gleams the\neternal joy of the spirit.\n    The second digit of the moon is a very subtle streak\nof light that is observed only for a short period before\nnightfall. It symbolizes the sprout of divine love, the\nforerunner of all spiritual development and fulfillment.\nIts very sighting is considered auspicious. Shiva as\nSarvatma-bhava vigraha is artistically described as\nhaving this crescent as his crest jewel.\n                                                    (Continued)\n                    (Courtesy : Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt.

All his cousins would spend the summer at\nAmmamma's place near Gokarna and they all looked\nforward to it. Parth loved everything about these\nvacations - the train journey with Amma and Priya   ,akka\nAmmamma's warm hugs and never-ending supply of\nAmchi delicacies, Ajja's anecdotes that would have\neveryone in splits, Dhruv dada's silly pranks, the visits to\nthe Math for the        , climbing trees andDeepa Namaskar\npicking mangoes with his cousins, swimming at the\nbeach,  and the icing on the cake - the       atRathotsava\nShirali! What's more, a bumper harvest of mangoes and\njackfruit promised to make this summer extra special!\nA few days into their idyllic summer, Ajja took the\nchildren out for ice-cream after a game of cricket. While\nthe children waited eagerly for their favourite Gudbud\nice-cream, Ajja asked them what they wanted for their\nbirthday this year.\nPat came the reply from Parth: \"A red bicycle!\"\n\"Done!\" said Ajja with equal enthusiasm.\nParth could not believe his ears... he had been wishing\nfor a red bicycle for so long. His wish would finally come\ntrue! He jumped with joy!\nNow he could join Priya    and her friends on theirakka\nbicycle ride around the neighbourhood. Oh! How much\nfun it would be! He could even start taking the bicycle\nto school... But would Amma allow him? He would have\nto convince Pappa first. How smart he would look on his\nshiny red bicycle! He would choose the best bicycle\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam            35                November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\naccessories to ensure that his bicycle outshined the rest.\nHe would even wash his bicycle every day to keep it\nshiny... Parth's mind was racing ahead like never before!\nFor a long time, Parth continued to be lost in thought\nuntil Ajja patted him on the back, \"Parth, are you done?\nShall we leave?\" When Parth looked around, he saw that\neveryone had finished their ice-cream. He looked at his\nown half-eaten, melted ice-cream. 'When did this\nhappen?' he wondered. He could only remember waiting\neagerly  for his ice-cream. Parth hesitated for a moment\nand then replied meekly, \"Okay, let's go.\" He trudged\nalong with the others and remained quiet for the rest of\nthe evening.\nThe next morning, Parth stayed indoors while the\nchildren picked mangoes from the trees. While they\nwatched a movie that afternoon, he sat quietly in the\ncorner, staring at a book. He even stopped laughing at\nAjja's anecdotes! Now Ajja could not hold himself back\nany longer. He sat down next to him and asked, \"Is\neverything okay, Parth? You seem very distracted. Is\nsomething bothering you?\"\n\"No, Ajja,\" Parth hesitated at first. But when Ajja smiled\nat him reassuringly, he opened up, \"I have been thinking\nabout the bicycle, Ajja. I don't think I want it anymore.\"\n\"Why not, Parth?\"\n\"Do you remember my friend, Shlok? Last year, he\nparked his bicycle outside the play-area and went to play\nwith his friends. When he returned, his cycle was\nmissing. He searched for it everywhere, but could not\nfind it. He was so upset. He got it back only after one\nwhole week! That's why I don't want the cycle anymore.\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam             36               November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nI am afraid... what if somebody takes it away or scratches\nit?\"\nNow, let us discuss...\n\n    *  In the beginning, do you think Parth was enjoying\n        his summer vacation?\n\n    *  Do you think Parth was able to enjoy his favourite\n        ice-cream? Why?\n\n    *  After returning home from the ice-cream parlour,\n        was Parth happy? What changed for him?\n\n    *  Can something that makes us happy also make us\n        sad or worried?

This helped to\nbring into focus the essence of Shiva   . It also madejnana\nit possible to spread this Knowledge to a wider audience,\nthereby benefiting not only the learned, but also the\ncommon people.\nAt Prayag, the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and\nSaraswati, where great Sages, holy men and the learned\nhad gathered, Suta was requested to reveal the Shiva\njnana               jnana. Explaining the potency of Shiva   , Suta said, \"\nReading, reciting or hearing the recitation of just one\nKatha or story, or even a part of it, let alone the whole\nShiva Purana, earns the Lord's Blessings, bringing\nredemption, salvation and deliverance from the cycle of\nbirth and death.

At all our auspicious functions - be it a\nbirthday or a festival, we commence with the lighting of\nthe lamp. Indeed, we worship light as the Lord Himself!\nKnowledge removes ignorance just as light removes\ndarkness. Further, knowledge is the greatest wealth by\nwhich all other achievements can be accomplished.\nHence, we light the lamp and bow down to knowledge\nas the greatest of all forms of wealth.\nWhat is the difference then, between a traditional lamp\nand a bulb or tube light? A flick of a switch will remove\ndarkness, is it not?\nThe traditional oil lamp has a spiritual significance. The\noil or ghee in the lamp symbolizes our      orvaasanas\nnegative tendencies and the wick, the ego. When lit by\nspiritual knowledge, the      get slowly exhaustedvaasanas\nand the ego too finally perishes. The flame of a lamp\nalways burns    upwards. Similarly, we should acquire such\nknowledge to take us towards higher ideals.\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam            41               November 2023\n------- PAGE END -------\nWhilst lighting the lamp we thus pray:\noerHees p3eeseflee Hejye'ie oerHees p3eeseflepe&veeo&vee ~\noerHees njleg ces O  evleb mebefJeIerHe veceessmleg les ~~Je\n\nThe Light of the Lamp represents the Supreme Brahman\nThe Light of the Lamp represents Janardana\nMay the Light of the Lamp remove my ignorance\nSalutations to the Light of the Lamp\n\nWhen we light the lamp in the evenings, we chant the\nDeepa Namaskar and offer our reverence to our sacred\nGuruparampara.

What\nsignificance can wealth and power have to a Sanyasi?\nThey have no value for him. If the wealthy man\noffers a large gift, what thanks can he give for\naccepting something that has no value for him? By\nthe simple process of a right appraisal of values, he\nfrees the wealthy and powerful from their pride of\ninfluence and power. There can be no pride in\npossessing things that have no value for another. To\nbe in the presence of such a one, there is a temporary\nrelease from pride of possession.\nHow does he meet the common man, the man in\nsorrow; how does he solve his problem? On one\noccasion, a woman, who had much sorrow created\nby many bereavements, asked him what could free\nher from her sorrow. The answer came quickly.\n\"Accept it, what is inevitable must be endured\". One\ncannot escape from the fact of death. There is no\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202426\nremedy that can bring the dead back to life. When\none sees the inevitability of it, one ceases to struggle\nor rebel against it. Sorrow is the result of our revolt\nagainst what has happened to us. To accept whatever\nhappens to us as facts that are unalterable is the\nbeginning of the ending of sorrow.\nIt is the simple and direct way of dealing with\nhuman problems that is the distinguishing mark of\nSwami Anandashram's technique. He has a profound\nsense of humour. He jokes with the lighthearted,\ndeals gently with the follies of the ignorant. At\nwhatever level many approach him, on that he meets\nus. That is supreme understanding which is Love.\nLove is thought of usually as relationship between\ntwo people. But it is something totally different and\nis, therefore, distinguished as Divine Love. It is like\nLight that reveals to us the inner structure of things.\nWhen any one enters the radiance of the Guru's\nLove, we feel that our hearts and minds are completely\nunderstood. It is our Guru's blessing to us, the grace\nthat brings harmony into our lives. It is this\nunderstanding that has bound almost every single\nindividual member of our Community to our Guru.\nThis is obviously, also, the secret of the way in\nwhich the Swamiji has tackled all problems. Because\nhe would not ask for anything for himself and left\nthe individual completely free to give or not to give,\nthe Community has given generously to the\nmaintenance of the Math. Because he will not exclude\nany one from receiving his blessings, no one will\nvoluntarily choose to get away from the communion\nwith the Math. Because he will not ostracise the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202427\nwidow who remarries, or any one who inter-marries\nor visits foreign countries, caste problems do not\narise. This is the simple formula, part of a very great\nTruth that the world has yet to learn, that there is\nno solution for the human problem by changing its\nouter organizational forms. You cannot make man\nnon-possessive by abolishing private property. You\ncannot make him moral by appointing vigilance\ncommission: get rid of corruption through Sadachar\nCommittees. Evil is in the heart of man and not in\norganisations. Love is the only solution for the human\nproblem and where there is Love no problems arise.\nWatching the Swamiji doing the little things of\nlife has deeply impressed me. During a Puja, I\nobserved the meticulous care with which he washed\nhis Danda. There was no hurry; slowly and carefully\nhe cleaned it. It was like a sacred ritual. It reminded\nme of the phrase that describes Nature's way of\ndoing the things \"unhasting but unresting\". There is\ncomplete tranquility in the way in which he deals\nwith the troubles that inevitably arise in our imperfect\nworld. He is in no hurry. He realizes that most\ntroubles solve themselves, if there is no impatient\ninterference on our part. Change the inner causes\nthat bring about the troubles, and the troubles will\ngradually dissolve themselves. To people like us,\nwho are impatient to change the world, there is a\ngreat deal to be learnt from his traditional way of\ndealing with problems.\nTeaching by silence is the traditional way of\nconveying spiritual grace from the Guru to the\nShishya, Dakshinamurti taught thus, and the Sage\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202428\nof Tiruvannamalai followed the same technique. It\nmay be worthwhile to make an attempt to understand\nthis way of teaching. When we are moved deeply the\nmind becomes silent. Watching a glorious sunset or\nsunrise, catching a glimpse of the Himalayan range\nor witnessing some great tragedy in human life,\nmakes the mind suspend its normal activity and be\nstill. All the great Masters of the spiritual life have\nconsidered stillness of speech, of heart and of mind\nas the essential conditions for the realizations of\nGod. \"Be still and know God\", says the mystic. This\nis true not only at the spiritual level but at all levels.\nIf you wish to control a noisy crowd of schoolboys,\nbe absolutely still yourself. This is more effective\nthan any amount of rebuking. If there is noise and\nexcitement all around you, complete detachment\nfrom it is the most practical way of ending it. It\napplies equally to the solution of difficult problems\nof research. The French Mathematician, Poincare,\nhas left on record how almost all his great\ncontributions to Mathematical Science came to him\nwhen his mind was completely silent. In the presence\nof the Unknown, the baffled mind becomes effortlessly\nsilent. As long as it seeks a solution from the past\nrecords of the memory, there will restlessness and\ndisquiet. When such attempts are abandoned, the\nmind becomes humble and there is a quiet into\nwhich Truth can descend.\nThis humility must be distinguished from the\ncalculating, false, cultivated humility that is only a\nnegative form of pride. It becomes spontaneous only\nwhen the mind is in the presence of the Unknown.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202429\nA great deal of Swami Ananadashram's success\nin dealing with the many problems with which we\nplague him is this complete absence of impatient\nhurry to fmd an immediate solution for them. \"He\nalways leaves things to God.\" What is meant by this\nphrase so commonly used but seldom understood?\nWhen some unexpected calamity overtakes us, there\nis an immediate reaction: grief, sorrow, even\nresentment. \"Why has this cruel thing happened to\nus?\" is the normal reaction. Not to react is merely\nto say to oneself, \"God alone knows why this has\nhappened\". It is the act of Faith that creates the\nattitude of mental silence. It is during the momentary\nsilence that the Truth is seen. This applies equally\nto our everyday problems. Some one is angry and\nshouts at us. Not to react immediately, but to quiet\nthe mind produces the conditions for the descent of\nthe Truth that tranquilizes the situation and brings\npeace and joy. This demands great maturity of mind\nand detachment. It is the way of great Gurus and it\nis conspicuously the way m our uuru. NO one has\nseen him lose his poise even in the midst of a\nserious crisis.\nIt is an unusual privilege that has been vouchsafed\nto the Saraswat Community to have as its Guru one\nwho demonstrates in his everyday life the Truth of\nthe teachings of our Rishis, and particularly of the\nBhagavad -Gita.\n(Concluded)\n(Courtesy : Fifty Years of Bliss\nSunbeam, September, 1981)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

In the\nnext few names, we have some suggestions as to how\nkama is conquered.\n38)  ojnemeefpeleebieve:\nHe who, with a mere smile conquered Parvati.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202444\nTo appreciate the beauty and full implications of\nthis name, one must go through the accounts of Parvati's\ncourtship of Shiva, as found in Shiva Purana and other\nworks. The points relevant to our purpose are: 1) The\nLord has not only vairagya, but beauty. One may choose\nto be a bachelor because he is not eligible for\nmatrimony, but that will not be vairagya. Tyaga of a\nbhoga is meaningful only when that bhoga is possible\nand actually available. Parvati, the incarnation of\nfeminine grace was ready to offer herself at His feet,\nbut the Lord was not to be tempted by physical charms,\nhowever holy and well intentioned it may be. He easily\novercame Cupid and at the same time was ready to\naccept Parvati's hand in marriage, for the sake of love\nand not through lust; in the name of Dharma and not\nfor sukha; because of her sincere tapas and not due to\npolitical pressure. This is the great beauty of the Lord\nwhich manifests as the flicker of a smile and that is\nenough to win over Parvati for all times.\nSecondly, the Lord'svairagyais not a dry obsession\nbut is full of rasa. He knows how to adore truth and\nappreciate beauty. His conquest of Parvati is a\ncommentary on his spiritual glory. He who is a slave to\npassion, will become a slave to woman also. In this\nconnection it is whorthwhile going throughSita's spirited\nreply to Ravana, when he comparesRama negatively.\nThirdly, the 'Angana' here can be taken to mean\nmukti (liberation) or Brahmavidya (knowledge), or\nbuddhi (Intellect that cognizes Brahman ) In the\nManasa Puja it is told: Delcee lJeb efieefjpee ceefle: This mukti or\njnana is conquered. It is acquired with great difficulty\non the part of the Sadhaka, who has to wage a war\nwith the opposing forces of darkness and deception.\nBut the whole thing is a play for the Lord who is above\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202445\nall this.

The\nAgamas actually define jiva, as the one who lacks power\n(MeeqkeIleoefjeer peerJe:) and the opposite of it is Ishvara.\n41)  #eerjsvog - mHeAefikeAekeAej:\n He who is like the milk or moon or gem of crystal.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202446\nShri Dakshinamurti acquires a similarity with the\nthree things mentioned above, but each with its one\ncharacteristic feature. The one common factor is the pure\nwhite radiance. Apart from that, the three represents\nrespectively, the outer, inner and innermost soul-nature\nof Shiva. The Lord's divine form is white like milk He is\ncool and resplendent like the moon, but actually He is\nthe atman who is without any attributes and hence\n'colourless' like the crystal(sphatika).\nThe crystal is a highly psychic gem. It also\ndemonstrates the 'Asangata' of atman. It receives all\nthe colours of its vicinity; appears to be ruby when\nplaced near a red hibiscus or an emerald when a bilva-\nleaf is offered to it. Similarly, the atman appears to be\ntainted with three gunas, while in reality he is the\nuntouched witness mee#eer (r)eslee kesAJeuees efveie&gCeee.\nThe three analogies may refer respectively to Sat,\nChit and Ananda aspects of Brahman. Also, we may\nnote; milk gives sustenance (HegefaOeo)  moon gives\nsweetness and joy (jmeOeo) while sphatika gives purity\n(Megefx) strength (MeeqkeIle) and self-knowledge (Deelce%eeve).\nThe pushti in the milk comes from the cow, which\ngets it from grass, which in turn derives it from the\nmoon. Moonlight is considered therasatama, one who\ninstills juicy essence in all edibles (Gita 15.13). But\nwe know that moon has no light of its own, it sheds\nwhatever light it gets from the sun. What makes it\ntransform this burning light into life-giving coolness?\nWhy moon-shine affects the minds of people? Can we\nsuppose that some minute crystal-like-particles are\nthere on the moon surface, which produce this\ntransforming power? We do not know, but we can say\ndefmitely that in Shri Dakshinamurti all these\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202447\nconnections of earth-moon-sun are very real and\nrelevant. He is a delightful personification of milky\n'moony' crystalline beauty.\n42)  #eerjsvogcegkegAiesppJeue:\nHe who is resplendent with the crown of the\nnectarine cresent-moon.\nAccording to mythology, as described in name\neight, the Lord accepted the moon as his diadem and\nby the sheer power of His proximity to the divine, the\nwaning moon acquired again the nature of waxing\nand thus able to regain his fullness every month.\nPerhaps it would be pertinent to say that it is not\nthe light of the moon that makes Shri Dakshinamirti\nradiant, but it is this act of His limitless grace, in\naccepting a sinner completely and eminently, that\nmakes Him gloriously resplendent.\n43)  #eerjesHenejjefmekeA:\nHe who is fond of milk-porridge offered in worship.\nThis name brings out therasikata of Guru. Kshira,\n(like all other offerings of the ritualistic worship, is\nonly a symbol. During the puja, the offerings are\npurified, and the mortal nature transformed through\nmantras and mudras; whereas kshira is verily amrta.\nIt symbolizes the developed \"well-cooked(HeefjHekeIJe) mind\nof the sadhaka , which possesses strength and\nsweetnes that are utterlysattvika. In it there is neither\nthe heaviness and dullness of affluence that is\ntamasika , nor the excitement and arrogance of\nrajasika achievement.\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy : Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar, Mt.

That strength comes not from\narrogance or insistence, but from belonging - I belong to\nShiva, I belong to the Guru. This is eternal. This will never\nleave you.\"\nH.H. Shrimat Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji\nSuraj was busy playing with his friends when Ajju finished his\nevening walk. \"Suraj, don't you want to practise for your music\ncompetition? It's almost dinner time now. Let's go home.\"\n\"Ajju, please give me 10 minutes more,\" Suraj pleaded.\nSummer holidays were over and the new academic year had\nstarted, but Suraj was still in a holiday mood. The school's inter-\nhouse music competition was just around the corner. Every year,\nSuraj represented his house and won. But this year, Ajju was\nconcerned that he did not seem to care enough.\n\"You have been procrastinating for so many days! Have you even\ndecided what you want to play?\" asked Ajju. \"Yes, I have. It's an\neasy song and I don't need practice,\" came the reply.\n\"Now, let's not get overconfident. I haven't seen you practising\neven once in the last few months. At this rate, you'll be lucky to\nrepresent your house even.\"\n\"Please, Ajju, relax! Our house comes first every year because of\nme. Of course, I'll be selected,\" Suraj retorted.\n\"Now, now, my child. Tread carefully. You are beginning to sound\narrogant,\" cautioned Ajju.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202463\n\"It's not arrogance, Ajju. I truly am the best in school. But more\nimportantly, I have been praying every night. Didn't you tell me that\nevery problem can be overcome with prayer? I am confident that\nwith Swamiji's Blessings, everything will go well.\"\n\"Very well then. See you at the dinner table in 10 minutes,\" said\nAjju, as he walked back home. Ajju knew that some lessons must\nbe learnt the hard way, so he allowed Suraj to have his way.\nOn the eve of the selections, Suraj began his keyboard practice. It\nhad been over 4 months since he had played it. To his dismay, he\nfound that his fingers were not as nimble as before. He was making\ntoo many mistakes! So, he practised over and over again. That\nnight, he prayed hard before going to bed.\nWhen Suraj returned from school the next day, he sat quietly\nbeside Ajju. \"You were right. I am sorry I did not listen to you,\" he\nsaid sadly.\n\"What happened, my child? Were you not selected for the\ncompetition?\" asked Ajju.\n\"I was the last to be selected, Ajju, and that too because Aarav was\nabsent today. My teacher said that I need a lot of practice.\"\n\"Well, the competition is a week from now. You still stand a good\nchance if you are willing to give it your best,\" Ajju reassured him.\n\"Hmm...\" Suraj nodded.\n\"It is good to be confident, my dear. But that confidence should not\ncome from thinking you are superior to others. In an ever-changing\nworld, such confidence is only temporary. Instead, let that\nconfidence and strength come from belonging to God, belonging to\nPujya Swamiji. Think of yourself as a mere instrument in His hands.\nEverything you have, including your talent, is a gift from Him, and\nyou must hone it to the best of your ability. Whatever you do, do it\nwith sincerity. Put in your best efforts, without any expectation or\ninsistence about the outcome, and then, offer it to Him.\"\nAs Ajju spoke, Suraj listened attentively, absorbing every word. He\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202464\nthen practised in all earnest for the rest of the week. On the day of\nthe competition, he remembered Pujya Swamiji before beginning\nhis piece. He then played the keyboard with all his heart, as though\nhe was playing it only for Pujya Swamiji, without any worry about\nits outcome. That day, he experienced a deep sense of fulfilment\nthat he had never experienced before.\nAre you wondering if Suraj won the competition? Well, after\nexperiencing the sheer joy of playing the keyboard with all his heart\nfor Pujya Swamiji, could there have been a better reward?\nKavyanjali: Prahlad's Faith\nVicissitudes come with ebb and flow\nThou are constant through joy and woe\nUnflinching faith is my only strength, I know\nIn thee I surrender, in thy presence, I grow.\nDuring the rule of Hiranyakashipu's might\nThe Gods themselves recoiled in fright\nA tyrant he was, though blessed with a boon\nOf a death with conditions many - could there be a riddance soon?\nImmortality the asura had sought\nAnd the gods were distraught\nHiranyakashipu was getting mightier each day\nHe inflicted evil through night and day\nA torrent of wicked he showered on his son\nFor having the audacity, he chose to shun\nMeanwhile, Prahlad devotedly prayed\nHe worshipped Lord Vishnu, unruffled and unswayed\nLivid with rage, he ordered the child to be killed\nThrew him off a cliff and employed assassins skilled,\nLet wild elephants loose and fed him poisons potent\nSummoned Holika to burn him in the pyre with death intent.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam April 202465\nUnsuccessful his plans proved to foil\nHarm steered clear of Prahlad despite the intense toil\nTo prove to his son, that 'faith' he could shake\nOne fateful day, a pillar he did break\nThe pillar broke apart with a tremendous blast\nBut Prahlad's faith was resolute and steadfast\nVishnu, in the avatar of Narasimha, arose\nSeeing the man-beast, Hiranyakashipu froze\nThe great asura trembled with fright\nSince it was neither day nor night\nThe terrible avatar he watched with fear\nThe asura knew that his end was near\nPrahlada had with his faith shown\nThat the Lord will always help his own\nNo harm will befall one nor any wrong\nWhen to the Lord, you belong!\nShiva Purana - Somnath - The First Jyotirlinga\nThe great king Daksha gave 27 of his daughters in marriage to Chandra\nDeva.

So, he went to Chandra\nand explained, \"You have been devoted to Rohi?i while ignoring the\nothers. You should be impartial to all.  Henceforth, you should treat\nthem all equally.\"\nChandra did not follow the advice. He continued to favour Rohi?i.\nFinally, the other wives were so upset that they had to request their\nfather, Daksha, to take stronger action. When reasoning failed, he\ncursed Chandra that he would waste away. Chandra started losing his\nlustre and began to wane. He was distraught and so were the other\ndevata-s and rishi-s. Indra and Vashishta led them to Brahma.\n Brahma answered their prayers with, \"Chandra has committed a\nmistake and so Daksha has cursed him. What is done cannot be\nreversed, it has to be remedied. Go to the great land of Prabhas and\npropitiate Shiva with M? tyunjaya yajna, incessant prayers and\npenance. If satisfied, Shiva will cure the disease.\"\nThe devata-s and rishi-s took Chandra Deva to Prabhas. There, they\ninvoked the holy waters of Saraswati and other rivers and\nconsecrated an earthen Shiva lingam. Leaving Chandra to perform\nthe M? tyunjaya rites, the devata-s and rishi-s returned to their\nabodes. Chandra performed the penance incessantly, reciting the\nM? tyunjaya mantra over a hundred million times with single-minded\ndevotion.  Thus propitiate d, Shiva manifested, \"Chandra!

NAGARKATTI\n\n    In the early hours of the morning, between 5.30\nand 6 one hears a mild pleasing sound of wooden\nsandals towards the southern side of the Math, One\nsees the bare body of the Master, resplendent with\nradiance, standing in the open in all kinds of weather\non the verandah of the Goshala to attend to the\nmorning ablutions. Three-quarters of an hour later,\nthe  same  sound  of  the  wooden  sandals  is  heard\nheading towards the Main Shrine of the Math. The\nMaster gracefully moves on, keeps aside the wooden\nsandals and stands in front of the Main Shrine to\noffer  His  morning  prayers  and  moves  on  to  do\nlikewise  at  other  shrines,  bare-footed.  Meanwhile,\ndevotees assemble aside to offer their pranams to\nthe Master when He is seated on one side of the\nChandrashala sipping a restorative offered to Him.\nThis done, the Master wears the sandals and turns\ntowards the eastern side and, leaving the sandals at\nthe foot of the staircase, goes up the stairs.\n    Completing a short course of yogasanas, which\nforms part of the daily routine, and partaking of the\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

The Master attends to all\nthese interruptions one by one with meticulous care,\nutmost perfection, dignity and grace. There is no\nhurry about the disposal, no hustling, because there\nare many things ahead to attend to. He reverts to\nHis previous work on hand, picking up the link, and\nis soon engaged therein, as if there were no breaks\nat all. Not a single moment is wasted. According to\npriority and urgency, the work that comes before\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        13                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe Master is attended to in an unperturbed and\ndetached manner. One notices that He is deeply\nabsorbed in work and yet, out of it. It is here, at His\nFeet, that one learns from actual practice that work\nis worship and, if done with perfection, Yoga. No\nsermons are required.\n   The time spent at His sacred Feet and His\ndivine presence, makes one aware of the meaning\nunderlying His way of dealing with this mundane\nworld -in it and yet, ever mentally and consciously\naway from it. Indeed, one is at once reminded of\nthe classic advice of Vasistha Rishi to Shri\nRamchandra:      Devleml3eeieer yeefnmme*ieer ueeskesA efJenj jeIeJe i.e.\nRaghava, go about in this world with detachment\nwithin and attachment without.\n   Thus, the Master is found seated in that one\nposture of padmasana for hours together until about\n1.30 a.m., when He comes downstairs. After taking\na cold water bath, the Master comes out in an ochre\ncoloured wet kaupina with wooden sandals on. He\nstands in that attire for a while at the corner of the\nMain Shrine, where the dried set of His usual clothes,\nconsisting of katisutra, kaupina, veshti and bairas,\nare made available to Him. The wearing, right from\nthe tying of the katisutra to that of donning the\nveshti, is so impressive and done with such perfection\nthat an onlooker is found absorbed in it.\n   After offering His obeisance at all the shrines,\nthe Master steps into the Sandhya Mantap. There,\nHe performs the most important of His daily\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       14                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nmeditations, namely, anushthana, for more than an\nhour. He devotes that much time under all\ncircumstances, however late it may be. During this\nperiod, so deeply absorbed is He found to be that it\nwould appear to any observer that the outer world\ndoes not exist for Him. If one should learn how to\ndraw his senses inward (antarmukha), the necessity\nof which the Master always stresses in His discourses,\nhe has only to observe Him during the meditation.\nMeanwhile, the daily naivedya and arati are offered,\nfollowed by the mantrapushpanjali ghosh of the\nvaidiks. The Master then partakes of holy tirth-\nprasada of all the shrines, sharing it with Shishya\nSwamiji. Thereafter, His Holiness comes out of the\nSandhya Mantap for padapuja             from the devotees\nwho receive tirtha from Him. They can also receive\nmantropadesh from the Master in the traditional\nmanner. His Holiness's padakanik and tirthakanik\nare counted within ten minutes. The Master, followed\nby Shishya Swamiji, proceeds towards the Bhiksha\nRoom. Here, hastodaka is offered to Him by devotees\nor, in their absence, by a Shukla Bhat. After\nhastodaka is accepted with a Tulasi leaf on the open\npalm, the Master takes His day's bhiksha (food). The\nquantity of food taken is limited under a regulation.\n    After bhiksha which is usually between 1.30 and\n2 p.m., the Master reclines in an easy chair for some\ntime in a room upstairs. It is literally forty winks.\nBetween 3 and 3.30 p.m., His Holiness steps down\nthe stairs to ease Himself and, at 4 p.m., He is up\nagain in the same room seated in Padmasana posture\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        15                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nand drinking a cup of tea. He then attends to the\ntapal (post). The clerk concerned reads the incoming\nand outgoing tapal before him. On rayas patras, His\nHoliness stamps the seal of blessings. He interrogates\nthe clerk, directs the corrections to be made in the\noutgoing letters, dictates telegrams of blessings etc.\nand instructs proper sevas to be performed on behalf\nof devotees seeking His guidance and blessings. Even\nduring the course of this work, interruptions of one\nkind or other take place and, yet, the Master works\nunperturbed.    He is always accessible.\n    The Master at times goes out for a walk in the\nevening. Twice a week, He takes His car for a drive\nto give it the needed exercise, as He puts it. Stopping\nit at a distance, far away from human habitations,\nthe Master, with brown rubber shoes on, starts\nwalking briskly. It is on such occasions and with\nthose fortunate ones who happen to accompany Him\nthat He cuts original jokes which drive them into\npeals of laughter, As, at most other times, His\nHoliness has a serene countenance, it is a treat to\nsee Him in such lighter moments. More often than\nnot, one gets rare spiritual lessons during these\noutings.\n    Between 7 and 7.30 p.m., after deepanamaskara,\nHis Holiness goes for a bath. Then He performs\nanushthana, while Arati, ashtavadhana etc are going\non. When there are night sevas like Kartik Pujas,\netc. His Holiness comes out and sits in his usual\nplace. Here, in the midst of Veda-ghosh of the vaidiks,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        16                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nHe gives Phala-Mantrakshtas and blessings to the\ndevotes who have done the pujas. On Friday nights,\nHe distributes tirtha. After the pujas, His Holiness\naccepts phalahara and, about three-quarters of an\nhour later, goes to the Western Chandrashala and\nsits in a chair for a little relaxation And reading of\nnewspapers. At times, He engages in conversation\npunctuated with jokes and anecdotes. At 11 p.m.,\nthe Master retires.\n    There are religious functions like Punyatithis\nNavaratri Festivals and Sadhana Saptahs, when much\nof His Holiness's time is taken up by the divine\nservices. His offerings of puja at all the shrines and\ndandavat pranipata before them is worth witnessing.\nWhatever be the number of visitors calling on Him\nto pay their respects, whatever be the strain involved\nin solving the spiritual problems of the devotees\nduring the interview period or in delivering\npravachanas, and whatever be the additional time\nspent on special occasions,        the Master acts with\nthe spirit of service enunciated by Him. \"This\nbody is given to the 'ten'    (Oee peCe) of the Community\nand as such, it should not care for any physical\ncomforts: it exists only for the benefit of others.\"\n    What a privilege it is to write about our Beloved\nMaster!\n\n(Courtesy : Fifty Years of Bliss and Sunbeam, September 1981)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        17                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Many\npeople have Shraddha, Bhakti but owing to various\ncircumstances, they are not able to visit the Math\nand  Guru.  So,  the  Standing  Committee  felt  we\nshould undertake an official tour which was also\npart of the Math tradition, and we thought likewise.\nSo, from the 22nd of last month, we are on this\ntour, listening to the laity's difficulties etc., talking\nto them about spiritual matters and trying to arouse\ntheir interest in these matters.\n    Adi Shankaracharya in Viveka Chudamani says\nthat whatever be the difficulties man has to face, he\nmakes himself eligible for attaining God Realization\nby the very fact of his having taken birth in a human\nform,  by  the  Grace  of  God.  Shankaracharya  also\nstresses that of all the things needed for man to\nattain liberation (Mukti), God's Grace is the greatest\nMan is always in search of happiness and all his\nday-to-day acts and activities are directed to this\nsole end. In fact, all creatures in this world seek\nhappiness, be they animals or human beings. Adi\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                               July  202418\n------- PAGE END -------\nShakti, while bringing into being this creation, has\nplaced all the objects of pleasure outside which keeps\nman distracted no matter how much he might try to\ngo within himself to reach the real fount of happiness.\nThe happiness one derives from external objects is\nnot the real happiness, it could be called the mere\nshadow, and not the substance of happiness. By the\nvery nature of his human birth, man is prey to\nmany ills of the body as well as the mind, and ills\nof day-to-day existence. That is why the Shastras\nask man to wake up and realise his true Self. They\nexhort on him to use his human birth to achieve\nliberation from this mortal coil.\n   The Shastras also tell us how this creation took\nplace, how in the beginning only Brahman, the\nGod, pervaded the entire universe and there was\nnothing else, and how He felt like bringing forth\nthis creation to enjoy His own play. As a result of\nHis wish, He created Adi Shakti to be the active\nforce of creation. Adi Shakti donned the role of\nMaya and, in turn, created Brahma, Vishnu and\nMaheshwar to mobilise the forces of creation,\npreservation and destruction. That is why we are\nasked to turn to the Divine Mother, the Adi Shakti,\nto get over the illusion of Her creation and achieve\ntrue happiness. Man by nature and from his very\nbirth is attuned to seeking satisfaction of his needs\nfrom external objects. As a new-born and an infant,\nhe is completely dependent on his mother and knows\nnothing and nobody else. As he grows older, he\nstarts identifying various objects and people around\nhim as his, and tells himself 'this is mine', 'this is\nmine' and so on, until he is completely submerged\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nin this world of Maya. Thus, he pursues worldly\nobjects for happiness, forgetting that such pleasures\nas he derives from them are transient and illusory.\nThat is why the Upanishads ask us to turn our back\non these transient pleasures, to renounce them and\nreach out for real happiness within us. Renunciation,\ntrue renunciation is not easy to achieve.\nRenunciation is of wo kinds, namely, Antar-tyaga\nand Bahya-tyaga. The latter means external\nrenunciation of physical objects while the former\nmeans renouncing desire itself for those objects from\none's mind and this is the real renunciation. As\nVashishta tells Rama, real renunciation must be of\nthe mind and not of the body. Physical renunciation\ndoes not have any value if one's mind continues to\nhanker after worldly objects, for which man must\nlearn to control his mind. In today's circumstances,\nrenunciation is more difficult than ever before as\nman is more engrossed than before in worldly\npursuits. So what should he do, because\nrenunciation is absolutely necessary to attain\nhappiness and liberation and yet he is unable to\nrenounce? Our ancients have prescribed many paths\nto follow, to attain liberation according to each man's\ncapacity. Every one must go by the Upadesh given\nto him by his Guru. Upadesh is different from\nAshirvachan, Pravachan etc. which are of general\nnature, meant for all, whereas Upadesh given by the\nGuru is intended for the disciple alone.\nNamasmarana is the ideal path for the present times,\nfor householders to follow, to reach the goal of human\nlife.\n   Bhakti is of many kinds. Merely performing\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nBhajan, Arati etc. is not Bhakti. Real Bhakti means\nsurrendering oneself completely to God, and coming\nto depend on Him for everything, just as a newborn\ninfant is wholly dependent on its mother and is\nconfident that she will look after all its needs, protect\nhim and so on. So also, man must come to look on\nGod as his sole protector and remain confident that\nGod looks after him all the time. There are three\nkinds of Bhakti. The first is to say I am yours. Just\nas waves rise and fall and might seem to be different\nfrom the ocean, I may appear different but I am\nYours alone. If a man develops this attitude, he can\nattain happiness, by considering himself as belonging\nonly to God. The second kind of Bhakti is to say:\nYou are mine. This gives man tremendous faith in\nHim. You must have heard of the story of\nBilwamangal, the blind devotee of Lord Krishna who,\non his journey to Mathura and Brindavan, fell into\na disused well and was rescued by Lord Krishna\nassuming a human form.However Krishna's touch is\nsuch that it can awaken one's inner vision and\nBilwamangal instantly realises who his rescuer is.\nAs soon as Krishna comes to know that Bilwamangal\nhas found Him out, he runs from the place and\nBilwamangal shouts after Him: \"Where do you think,\nYou are running away from me, Krishna? You may\nrun away from me outside but I have caught You in\nmy heart. See how You can get away from there!'\nThis feeling comes out of the attitude You are mine.\nThere is also Kumarila Bhat's case. His was aggressive\nBhakti in which he used to take the Lord frequently\nto task, so strong was his conviction that the Lord\nwas his. Once he went to Kashi Vishwanath's temple\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       21                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nand found the doors of the temple closed. Standing\noutside, he berated the Lord, asking Him if He has\nbecome so proud because of all the devotion offered\nto Him by so many people that He had closed the\ndoors to him. This was not said in anger but in real\nemotion (Bh   av) and staunch feeling of You are mine.\nThis leads us to the third kind of Bhakti, where one\nidentifies oneself with all beings in the feeling of All\nare mine. The sorrows and difficulties of everyone\naround us become ours and, in fact, we come to\nregard the entire universe as our own form.\n   During our stay here (at Talmakiwadi(, we have\nbeen giving interviews in the mornings and many\nare the questions pertaining to Japa. We want to\nanswer some of these here.         Bhakti can be done\nanywhere and everywhere, but Japa cannot be\ndone like that. Sandhyavandan is different from\nPranayam. The Shastras tell us that if man forgets\nhis duty he commits sin and Sandhyavandan is\nprescribed to protect man from committing sins.\nSandhyavandan has its own rules like\nBhasmadharan, Achaman etc.          But, the real object\nof Sandhyavandan is to help us to remember God.\nWhy are we asked to do Japa? Man is not free from\nthe cycle of births and deaths and he goes from one\nbody to another. Once he is born, whether of his\nown free will or unwittingly, he goes on committing\nsins. Japa helps him to vanquish his sins and\ncleanses him of the sins of all his past lives. That is\nthe real purpose of Japa. Why should people in\npresent times perform Japa of Gayatri? Because,\nmerely by listening to our Ashirvachan and the advice\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       22                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ngiven therein, they will not be able to implement it\nbecause of their preoccupation in their worldly duties.\nSo, Gayatri japa is prescribed. It also helps to avert\npremature death. Even if you are to perform Japa\nfor five minutes, after your morning bath, it will\nsuffice. The Upanishads promise that Gayatri will\nhelp man to live upto 100 years. Whether one will\nlive that long or not, there is no doubt that Gayatri\ncan help man to lead a happy and healthy life, he\nwill never be in want and he will attain knowledge\nwithout even reading, he will be revered and\nrespected on all sides and he will endear himself to\neveryone and become popular. All this comes from\nperforming Gayatri Japa.\n   Today is H. H. Vamanashram's Punyathithi and\nwe can do no better than to quote Gauranga\nMahaprabhu's invocation to the Lord and,\nremembering Anandashram Swamiji, offer the same\nto His Holy Feet:\n   \"O Krishna! I don't want to be called a Sadhaka\nor a Bhakta. All I crave for is the dust of Thy holy\nfeet. I don't want people's respect, name, fame etc.\nAll I want is that in every birth, give me intense\ndevotion for Thee. When I remember Thee, tears\nshould fall from my eyes, my throat should get\nchoked, and my body should feel thrilled. Keep\nme, O Lord, ever at Thy feet.\"\n   In conclusion, we want to say that we are much\npleased by all your love and devotion and we dedicate\nthe same at the Feet of Lord Bhavanishankar and\npray to Him to fulfil all your desires and grant you\neverlasting peace and happiness.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       23                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Not giving\nroom to unwanted desires is control of mind. Unwanted\ndesires are those whose fulfilment grants us neither\ncontentment nor happiness and only serves to inflict\ntrouble on others.\n\n    We know from our experience that a disgruntled man,\non account of his own greed, suffers. Therefore , curbing\ndesires under all circumstances and living strictly in\naccordance with Dharma (righteousness) will ensure that\nwe, and others around us, live in contentment.\n\n    In the Mahabharata, an avaricious Duryodhana\nresorted to Adharma (unrighteousness) and inflicted harm\non others. That he brought about his own destruction as a\nconsequence is a known fact. Similarly, even after\nrepeated conquests of the world, Lord Indra was never\ncontent.\n\n    A person, who is satisfied with whatever he has, will\nlead a happy life without any worries, even thougth he\nmay be poor.\n              Demevlees<e: Hejb og:Keb mevlees<e: Hejceb megKeced~\n             megKeeLeea Heg(c)<emlemceeled mevlega: meleleb YeJesled~~\n\n    Our blessings for all to attain that contentment\nwhich is central to obtaining happiness.\n\n                                            (Courtsery : Tattvaloka)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam           31                      July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

In other words it is the evolutionary force\nin all creation, ever restless to seek fulfilment. In\nSanskrit language it is usually used for snake. Hence\nthis force has been depicted as a snake. As we have\nseen, this pictorial representation corresponds very\nwell to several aspects of this creative force.\n49)   cete|leefveeqvoleJeAvoHe&:\n    Whose form puts to shame the most charming\nKandarpa (god of love).\n    Physical beauty is nothing compared to spiritual.\n    Kamadeva just looks at the Gurudeva and takes\nto his heels.

But when he desires to dwell\ncontinuously on Him at all times (as in the Vibhuti\nYoga - Ch 10 of Gita), he is advised to envisage the\nwhole universe as the Lord's body and accept not\nonly external forms, but also the unseen power of\nthings and (more subtler and fundamental than that)\nthe indwelling spirit of all    (Denceelcee ieg[eJesAMe meJe&YetleeMe3eeqmLele:).\n    Thus, the aspirant is asked to go beyond the\nconflict of God with forms and without forms.

Shivlinga represents the\ncosmos also, because the latter is also murta-amurta,\nin as much as it is made up of the pancha bhutas, of\nwhich Akasha and Vayu are amurta, while the\nremaining three are murta.\n    What has been told about Shivlinga is also true\nof the Omkara, the best Shiva-name.

It is like lighting a candle at night. Whatever\nmay be the power of the lamp, the night is not\nremoved. That is possible only through the rising of\nthe Sun. Similarly Brahmajnana alone can destroy\nthe root-ignorance. If the root is retained, one may\ncut the branches or shear the leaves but they weill\nsprout again and again. Even so, our efforts at worldly\nenlightenment do not provide a solution to the various\nmisconceptions and sufferings, that arise out of the\nignorance pertaining to the very ground of our being.\nHence it is called 'root ignorance'.\n    Sri Dakshinamurti is the only source of\nBrahmavidya and hence he is compared to the Sun.\nThe idea is again elaborated in name fifty-three.\n52)  cete|leceledJeAuHeHeeoHee\n    He who is the embodiment of the fabled wish-\nfulfilling tree.\n    The 'kalpa' tree is said to grant all wishes of the\nperson who takes shelter under it.

Vedanta explains\nthat desire (kama) is an outcome of avidya, ignorance\nof one's own ever-fulfilled joyous nature. The\nignorance has already been referred to in the\nprevious name as the cause of Samsara, which is\nexterminated by the Guru to grant liberation to the\nenlightened soul; but in so doing, what happens to\nthe souls is difficult but all-the same an irresistable\nquestion that arises.

Will it not reduce that living being to the\nlevel of the Insentient, or elevate it beyond the normal\njoyous responses of a healthy life? Though these are\ndeep philosophical issues that have never been\nresolved, the Sadhaka is content to believe that the\njivamukta is as much, if not even more, in the hands\nof God as he was in the advanced stages of sadhana\nwhen total surrender takes place. To such souls, the\nLord's famous declaration in the Gita           'les<eeb efvel3eeefYe3egJeIleeveeb\n3eesie#esceb Jenec3enced\" applies squarely. The Lord fulfills all their\nneeds on the plane of their mundane existence. He\nbecomes their kalpa - vriksha.\n    Another idea is that the word 'kalpa' stands for\n'sankalpa'. The tree of sankalpa refers to that\nexcellent mind ever tuned to the cosmic will, so that\neach one of its sankalpa is a 'shiva-sankalpa', which\ncannot but be fulfilled through fruits of goodness\n(Shivata).

Avani's friends\nwere gushing over a painting that Purvi, the new girl in\nschool, had made. Aarush rushed to see it, dragging Avani\nbehind him. Avani was stunned by what she saw! Purvi had\npainted a busy marketplace. She had captured its vibrant\natmosphere, the bright colours of the fresh produce and the\ndistinct expression of every person skilfully to make the\npainting come alive! 'How could a 14-year-old paint like that?'\nAvani wondered. She felt so small in comparison. It would\ntake her a lifetime to reach that level!\nAvani felt a knot in the pit of her stomach as she turned and\nwalked away from the group. Her mind was racing ahead --\n'Why is Sanvi gushing over the painting so much? She seems\nso eager to be friends with Purvi. Does she like her more\nnow?' Avani was caught in a whirlwind of emotions that were\nnew to her.\nWhile Avani struggled to make sense of her mixed feelings,\nAarush came running behind her. \"Purvi's painting is amazing!\nIsn't she in your class? You both paint so well! You two will\nmake good friends,\" Aarush suggested. \"Oh please, Aarush.\nShe is not a nice girl. Everyone is being extra good to her only\nbecause she is new to the school,\" Avani replied agitatedly.\n\"Why?

The principle of\nconsciousness which is present in the animal creation is but\npart of this Paramatman. But, oblivious of this fact as a result\nof Maya's veil, man imagines that he is the material body,\nbecomes subject to a succession of joys and sorrows, and\nthereby suffers. To dispel this ignorance and \"to know the\nnature of the Atman is the main aim of religion\". (Yajnyavalkya\nSmriti 1-8)\nAccording the Bhagavad Gita (111-3), there are two paths\nin religion, namely, action and knowledge. But the same Gita\nmaintains (XVIII-55) that the Paramatman can be known\nthrough devotion as well. These two declarations may seem\ninconsistent. But it appears to us that worshipping the\nParamatman by the observance of Varnashrama Dharma also\nconstitutes devotion. It would thus be clear that the paths of\naction and devotion are one. Shri Shankaracharya has\nexpressed this idea in one place; and further, in his\ncommentary on the Gita, he has interpreted devotion as\nJnananishtha  and embodied it in the path of knowledge as\nwell.\nOn the whole, it is clear from this that devotion does need\nthe help of right conduct (achar) and right thought (vichar).\n(Delivered in course of the northern tour of 1937-\n38, and published in Kanara Saraswat in May 1938)\nIS THERE NO PATH BESIDES\nKNOWLEDGE AND ACTION?\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 20226\nDevotion bereft of these and going by the name of love, is apt\nto drag men down the slippery slope. It is hardly necessary to\nstate that Ramakrishna Paramahansa was one who knew the\nsecret of devotion. A boy who had acquired a name as a prince\nof devotees was once brought to him. It was generally known\nthat the very utterance of the name of God had the effect of\nbringing out the eight bhavas in him sand sending him into\ndeep meditation. But the moment Ramakrishan saw him, he\nremarked that the boy was raw (kacha). Although this\nsurprised the people then assembled, the boy's absorption in\nworldly affairs soon thereafter made them realize that what\nthe Paramahansa had said was true. Instances have come to\nnotice in which a few members of our Community have\nneglected their wives and children and have, nevertheless,\nbecome famous as great devotees. The company and service\nof saints have doubtless been prescribed (Gita, IV-34), but\nwhen Bhartrihari asks \"How many such saints are there in\nthis world?\" It is obvious that genuine ones are rare indeed.\nAccording to the Gita, too. \" Among thousands of men scarcely\none strives for perfection; of the successful strivers scarcely\none knoweth Me in essence\"(VII-3), Imitation ware has the\nbetter shine; even so, seeming saints possess the greater\nattraction. Hence it is most necessary to be on one's guard in\nthe search for the true seer.\nNevertheless, as the Gita says that even if the most sinful\nperson worships, God with single-minded devotion, he too\nmust be accounted righteous (IX-30), it may be contended\nthat the repetition of the name of God will alone wash away\nall sins and lead to liberation. It should be remembered,\nhowever, that the emphasis here is on single-minded devotion\nwhich is rarely met with. Again, even as little children were\nbeing told in the old days that a drink of the decoction of\ngulancha (amritaballi) makes the hair on the head grow nicely,\nthe hope of a fine grown of hair being the inducement held\nout to them to drink the decoction, the pronouncement in\nthe Gita seeks to describe the glory of devotion and not to\ncountenance sinful conduct. Seeing that it states further on\n(IX-31) that the devotee speedily becomes a dharmatma and\ngoeth to eternal peace, it is clear that the devotee can secure\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 20227\nliberation only by the steady observance of Dharma and has\nno chance of obtaining it if he persists in sinful ways. The\nNarada Bhaktisutras which proclaim devotion as the principal\nmeans, also prescribe adherence to right conduct in the shape\nof harmlessness etc.\nDevotion is of two kinds- para and apara. The former, as\ndeclared by Shri Shankaracharya, is included in the path of\nknowledge. As love of God is likely to take firm root only in\nthose who acquire dispassion towards the objects of sense,\nthis parabhakti, which is intense love for the Lord, is not\npossible for ordinary people. Aparabhakti is prescribed for\nthem; and as it involves action, it may be included in the\npath of action. Hence it is not incorrect to say that there are\nonly two paths.\nJust as restraints are more important than rules in the\npath of action, pure unalloyed devotion characterized by\nharmlessness is pleasing to the Paramatman, as is evidenced\nby the examples Vidura, Shrutadeva etc. The worship of images\nand the method of silent repetition (japa) are also common to\nthe paths of devotion and action.\nMay the Paramatman inspire all in ways of devotion which\nare not dissociated from right conduct and right thought!\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

A seeker who practises\nBhakti gains Knowledge . Bhakti is not the mechanical\nprostrations we do to God's images, the lighting of\nlamps etc. This is merely a tradition and we follow\nour parents and grand-parents. But, Bhakti with\nShraddha means that before we do Namaskar to\nShiva or Krishna, we first mentally become Shiva or\nKrishna and then prostrate and carry on the worship.\nIn this way, we develop concentration in Shraddha.\nThis reminds us of a story. A disciple with dispassion\nand desiring the Bliss of Self (Atmanand) went to a\nGuru and begged him for self-knowledge (Tatwa-Jnan).\nGuru gave the disciple a mantra (Harinah Patu) (May\nLord Vishnu protect us) and asked him to do the Japa\nuntil he got Guru's signal to stop. The disciple who\nhad great Shraddha went into a cave, did not eat or\ndrink anything and did continuous Japa for two months.\nWhen the Guru called him, the disciple said that he\ndid not get what he was searching for. Guru then told\nthe disciple that he could eat and drink but do the\nJapa understanding the meaning of the mantra.\nJapa must be done with faith. The disciple then\ndid Japa with faith but misunderstood the mantra as\nreferring to a deer (Harina). At the end of two months,\nwhen Guru asked the disciple to come out of the cave\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\nSHRADDHA\n(Summary of an Ashirvachan in Hindi at\nThunder Bay, Canada, on Wednesday,\nJuly 18, 1979)\n(Continued...)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 20229\nthe disciple said : \" O Bhagavan! I have got horns\ntouching the ceiling of this cave and, so, I cannot\ncome out.\" This shows the power of Shraddha; the\ndisciple meditating on the deer had identified himself\nwith the deer! Guru was astonished and, naturally,\nsaw no horns. Guru then explained the meaning of\nthe mantra to the disciple who finally succeeded in\nhis pursuit. So, whatever faith one has, so does one\nbecome. We must repose this Shraddha on the Atma-\ntatwa or the Self. In this 20 th Century, doing Pooja,\nrituals etc. is difficult but even here in the West,\npeople hear a lot about Bhakti, Transcendental\nmeditation, Upanishads etc, and think there must be\nsomething in them and they too must do something\nalso. It is good to repose faith in the Lord.\nThere are three types of Bhakti :\ni) I am Yours :  \"I do not care what happens to\nme because, O Lord, I am Yours, and You know\nwhat is best for me.\" This is how Prahlad and Dhruva\nthought. Any number of hardships did not matter to\nthem.\nii) You are mine.  This comes after the first. It is\nnot from the ego of the devotee but the devotee\nsincerely feels that the Lord is his. There is a\nbeautiful story about Surdas that we often narrate.\nSurdas was born blind and was a great devotee of\nLord Krishna. He wished to touch the ground on\nwhich Krishna walked, and, so, with great difficulty,\nhe walked from Kashi to Mathura. Unfortunately,\nwhen he called Krishna, \"I have come thus far to feel\nthe ground on which You set Your feet but I have\nnow fallen into this pit. I cannot come out\", Krishna\nnaturally was moved at the plight of His devotee and\nHe pulled out Surdas from the pit by taking the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202210\nguise of a Brahmin . But, as soon as the Brahmin\ntouched Surdas, the Divine touch opened Surdas'\neye of wisdom (Jnana-chakshu) and he 'saw' Lord\nKrishna. Surdas began praising the Lord bur Krishna\nhastily withdrew after the rescue, Surdas lost his\nvision and smilingly said : \"Oh Lord! You are afraid\nand have no courage to hold my hand. So, you left\nmy hand. All right. But, you are helpless because\nYou are enshrined in my heart and You cannot\nleave it.\" Here, Surdas' bhavana is that the Lord is\nimprisoned helplessly in his heart.\niii) You are Myself . This is the final stage in\nBhakti. First, 'I am Yours', then 'You are mine' and,\nfinally, 'I am You'. The great devotee Mirabai has\nsaid: \"Krishna's Blissful Light is everywhere; wherever\nI see, there is this Light and, as I go on seeing this\nLight, I myself become that Light\".\nIn Bhakti, one must have this Shraddha. Objects\nof worship are many, namely, Ganesha, Vishnu,\nKrishna, Rama, Sita, Christ, but one must keep faith\nin the above three ways. One must understand Atma-\ntatwa which is all Bliss. One must look upon the world\nas a movie. We must act but the result, happiness or\nsorrow, is a passing show and should not affect us.\nHuman birth is rare and because of our rare gift\nof intellect, one must use it to learn about the Lord.\nOtherwise, we will suffer a great deal in this wheel\nof births and deaths. We must see Brahman in\neverything. Everybody, we must enquire. \"What is\nthe meaning of all this Samsara? What is the purpose\nof my life? Where do I want to go?\" Finally, we pray\nto the Lord to bless you with a successful Sadhana\nending in Self-knowledge.\n(Concluded)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Accept it, tackle it, do\nnot try to evade or take it easy. Throught this tapas\nalone Brahma-jnana has to come--not by merely\nsaying Aham Brahmasmi over and over again. Many\npeople indulge in that, are advised to do that. It may\nresult in a sort of self-hypnotism; that person may\nreally begin to believe that he is Brahman. But will\nit reveal to him the meaning and beauty of every\npulsation of life, or will it make him devoid of them,\nspared from them by this hypnotic spell which covers\nhim like the shell of a tortoise?\nI do not mean that repeating is bad. It is a Vedic\nmantra and certainly the use of it with reverence\nand proper pronounciation will be meritorious. It\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202219\nwill be a japa or svadhyaya which is recommended\nby the scriptures. But what will you get by it? The\nYogasutra says that by svadhyaya you will acquire\nintimacy with that particular aspect of Godhood\nwhich the mantra used by you refers to. And this\nintimacy is termed samprayoga, indicating a capacity\nto transact with it.\n\"That I am\" gives you the chinmatra-sara. \"And\nall this world also I am\" gives you the chinmatra-\nvistara. From the essence you go to the expansion.\nThis expansion is possible because of the nature of\njnana which is understood better in this expansion.\nMotionless Rest\nThis constant going out and coming in of your\nessence is the vistara, expansion. The motionless\nrest within, vishranti  is the sara . Both are\ninseparable. Both are one. And if you come to accept\nthe fact that apart from the above extension of\nyourself, the reality of the world is not to be found\nand everything becomes untenable, then it is obvious\nthat world and 'I' are separated only as the vistara\nand sara of the same principle called samvit. If you\nhave experienced your reality as the sara, the seer\n(sakshi, drishta, aham ), you may also experience\nthe same reality as the vistara--the seen ( sakshya,\ndrisya, idam ).\nThis has been beautifully illustrated by the story\nof the demon Raktabija whom Goddess Durga\ndestroyed. We have graphic accounts of the episode\nin popular works, such as the Devi-Mahatmya of\nMarkandeya Purana and the Devi Bhagavata . The\ndivine power invoked by the gods was confronted by\nmassive forces of the king of demons, Shumbha.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202220\nContingent after contingent was exterminated by\nthe divine forces manifested by mother as Brahmani,\nVaishnavi, etc.\nBut when the turn came for Raktabija to fight,\nthe divine forces found all their attempts not only\nfutile but fatal. Because, every time Raktabija was\nslain, he rose again a hundredfold, due to the boon\nthat from every drop of his blood spilt on the ground\nan asura would be produced of equal might and\npossessing the same peculiarity of multiplaying\nhimself through every drop of blood shed.\nTherefore, the more the Matrikas intensified their\nassaults the greater grew the number of Raktabijas,\ntill they overspread the entire field. The gods were\nseized with the agonising question: How to kill the\nRaktabijas without fighting? The divine mother smiled\nand gently instructed Chamunda to open wide her\nterrible jaws, extend her tongue and receive all the\nblood shed as the Matrikas went on clearing the\nexisting bodies of Raktabijas. Prevented from falling\non the ground, the blood ceased to reproduce and\nin no time the divine forces were able to eliminate\nthe Raktabijas.\nThe world is the demon Raktabija for whom\ndestruction is creation. A sadhaka unwittingly tries\nto do away with it by simply denying it, mentally\ntearing it to pieces or turning  a deaf ear to its\ndemands. By this he only strengthens the\nworldbondage, increases the clamour of the seen.\nAnd the pious devotee, like the fallen gods, is filled\nwith dismay: \"Is God also going to fail me?\" Gid\nsmiles and instructs: \"It is not enough to cut at the\nworld, learn to consume it at the same time.\"\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202221\nBlood of the World\nThe secret power of the world does not lie in the\nbulk or body of it but in its blood; and that has to\nbe tackled, provided for properly. The blood of the\nworld is avidya or maya. Out of this the world-\nscene is constructed (DeefJeDe3ee keAefuHeleced)  and this avidya\nor imaginative power belongs as much to\nconsciousness as the vidya or cognitive power. So\nconsciousness should have no difficulty in consuming\nwhat is its own. Only the exact means fit for that\nfunction have to be employed. In the illustration\nrakta is rasa, essence of the body, and can be\nreceived or absorbed only by rasana, the tongue. So\nChamunda's extended tongue achieves what all the\nweapons of the Matrikas could not. Chamunda\nbecomes, according to Devi Mahatmya, efJemleeefjleevevee,\nVistaritanana.\nMother's Tongue\nThis is a hint for you to make your prajna the\nvistarita chaitanya . The present shloka, therefore,\npresents jagat as chinmatra vistaritam and this is\nconsumed, made one with 'I'. This is bliss. This is\nthe significance of the mother's tongue. The terrible\nform with its darting red flame-like tongue ( lalijjihva)\nis gruesome only to the apparent and the unknowing.\nTo the real it means something else.\nIn the Yoga Bhashya  attributed to Maharshi\nVyasa, we come across the story of Bhagavan\nJaigavishya who practised a particular difficult\nsamyama (deep meditation) on certain aspects of\nthe mind. As a result there arose in him a knowledge\nof the past cycles of creation. When sages Avatya\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202222\nheard of this he came to ask of Jaigavishya, \"Please\ntell me what was the wonderful spectacle of the ten\ncycles you saw at one stroke\". \"The spectacle,\" came\nthe answer, \"was one picture of sorrow\". Avatya was\nnot only disappointed but disturbed. He insisted,\n\"How can that be? You are so much advanced in\nyoga and you found nothing but sorrow, when in\nthe very beginnings of ashtanga yoga we are told,\nunder the discipline of yama, that he who has\nmastered thje virtue of contentment ( santosha) gets\nan unsurpassed joy\".\nJaigavishya smiled and said,\"My dear Avatya, what\nis told there in the context of santosha is true in\nthat stage. After you have got that contentment if\nyou wish to proceed higher you will be seized with\na great discontent. From the viewpoint of the\nsupreme bliss of samadhi, the ultimate illumination,\nall other satisfactions of the lower steps are\nunbearable sorrows only\".\nThat is why this verse speaks of the sukhatara,\nthe greater joy, because this is the state of manana\nor introspection which is a strengthening of\nshravana, the initial illumination of prajna. We\ncannot stop here, we must go to nididhyasana, a\nstill deeper state in which is achieved the sukhatama,\nthe greatest joy, the most perfect bliss. We must go\nahead to worship the fullest developed form of the\nGuru. This will be taken up in the next verse, where\nwe are given deeper insights into what is claimed\nhere as the bliss and purity of the Atman.\n(Continued...)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar,\nMt.

RAJAGOPAL BHAT\nFeasts and fasts are there in every religion. They\nalternate with each other. While feasts constitute a\nmild form of self-indulgence, fasts constitute a form\nof self-denial. Thus, they balance each other and give\npractical religion its natural equipoise.\nWe fast on Ekadashi, Sankashthi, Shivaratri, etc.\nMany of us fast on specific week days too.\nWhat is the rationale of fasting? It is said that all\nsins inhere in annam (food). (yani kani cha papani..\nannam ashritya tishthanti..). Mahabharata poses the\nquestion : Will not a hungry man commit sins?\n(bubhukshitah kim na karoti papam). So, to break this\nnexus between food and sin, we should voluntarily\nstay away from food. One who conquers hunger,\nconquers everything (bubhuksham jayatey yastu sa\nsarvam jayatey dhruvam) . There is an accession of\nwill-power, an exhilarating sense of self-control when\nwe fast. Normally, we are slaves of the palate. When\nwe fast, the palate takes the backseat. It is we who\nthen call the shots.\nBrihadaranyaka Upanishad says:\nme Jee S<e cenevepeDeelcee...lecesleb JesoevegJe(r)evesve ye'eieCee:\nefJeefJeefo<eefvle 3e%esve oevesve leHemee DeveMekesAve ~\n\"Brahmins desire to know the Supreme Self by\nVedic study, sacrifices, dana and tapas such as\nabstention from food.\" (IV-4-22)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202224\nSo, fasting is a mild form of tapas (penance).\nIn Gita, we read:\nefJe<e3ee: efJeefveJele&vles efvejenejm3e osefnve : ~\njmeJepeY= jmeessscH3em3e Hejb C/<idJee efveJele&les ~~\n\"The objects of the senses go back from him who\nis on fast. The relish, however, still lingers and will go\naway only when the Supreme has been seen.\" (II-59)\nFasting should not be an unbearable infliction on\noneself. Krishna frowns upon such self-inflicted\nordeals as demoniac(asuri). There is nothing spiritually\nennobling about such ordeals which strain one's\nendurance to the breaking point. To the Lord, they\nsmack of violence, violence to the physical organism\nas also to Him who is enshrined within the hearts of\nall. (Gita XVII-6)\nWe read in the New Testament:\n\"When ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad\ncountenance. But, thou, when thou fastest, anoint\nthine head and wash thy face. that thou appear not\nunto men to fast, but unto thy Father who is in secret,\nand thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee\nopenly.\" (Mathew VI-16-18).\nIn other words, fasting should be cheerfully\nundertaken and should not be too long lest it saps\none's endurance and makes for uneasiness. Upavasa\nis just a means, not an end in itself.\nOur sacred books enjoin that anyone between the\nages of 8 and 80 is eligible to fast (DeaJe<ee&efOekeAes cel3eexs\n?eMeereflev3etveJelmej:) If one (say, an ailing or elderly person)\nwishes to observe a fast, but is physically unable to\nabstain from food completely for a whole day, then\neka bhukta (food only once) is permitted. Thus, there\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202225\nis a humane face to fasting in our religion.\nWhat is Ahara (food)? In Vedantic parlance, it means\nmuch more than mere food for our palate. Whatever is\ngathered (ahriyatey)  by our senses is Ahara. So\nUpavasa, though it begins with abstinenec from food\nthat we eat, should not end with it alone. We have to\nmake a leap from Upavasa for the stomach to Upavasa\nfor the senses. If we just keep away from the the dining\ntable, but not from the sensory temptations, the purpose\nof Upavasa is not fulfilled.\nThe second line in the Gita verse (II-59), quoted\nabove, is very significant. When one fasts - in the true\nsense of the term i.e. staying away from sensory trivia -\nno doubt, the sense objects (vishaya) are kept at bay.\nHowever, the insidious relish for them, the secret\nyearning for them, still lurks within our sub-conscious.\nThis relish will go away only when the Supreme is seen,\nwhen we realise Him. Lord is the Supreme Delight(raso\nvai sah). When our mind gets a taste of Him, the relish\nwe have for the lesser delights just evaporates. It is not\nsuppressed or repressed, but simply transcended.\nHence, the observance of fasting should go hand\nin hand with spiritual exercises: Mouna (silence),\nNama-smaran, japa, dhyana, study of holy books, etc.\nOur mind is the eleventh (manam ekadasham\nsmritam) element, towering above the five sensory\n(jnana) and five motor (karma) organs (indriya). When\nthis mind, always flitting from one thought to another,\nis laid to rest - that is the true Ekadashi.\nThe sacred books make it mandatory to have Hari-\njagara on the night of Ekadashi. Bhajans, keertans,\ndevotional dancing - being 'awake' (jagara) to Hari by\nsuch means is lavishly praised. The world without goes\nto sleep, but the fasting devotee is awake within. This\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam September 202226\nwakefulness and constant remembrance of God is the\nkeynote of Upavasa.\nThis reminds me of a beautiful passage of\nParamahamsa Yogananda (author of Autobiography\nof a Yogi ):\n\"The best time to offer our love to God is at night\nwhen you are free and the world is asleep. Take your\nheart away from everything and give it only to God in\ndeep meditation. I practiced that. Now, no matter what\nI am doing, working or meditating, my mind is on\nGod. So it must be with you. When you become drunk\nwith God, you don't lose your balance even in the\nmidst of troubles and activities.\"\n\"Never go to bed until you have made real contact\nwith God. Then, in the daytime, you will be able to\nconquer all the temptations and destructive forces that\nconfront you. Nobody can take your peace away from\nyou. Nothing can take away that divine love between\nyou and God. Be determined.\"\nThe very word Upavasa is self-explanatory. A verse\nspells out its significance as under.\nGHe meceerHes 3ees Jeeme: peerJeelce Hejceelcevees: ~\nGHeJeeme: me efJe%es3ees ve leg keAe3eefJeMees<eCeced ~~\n\"When the individual soul (jeevatman) stays (vasa)\nclose (upa) to Paramatman, that is known as Upavasa.\nUpavasa does not mean just a deprivation for the\nphysical body.\"\nTo stay away from food (for the stomach as well as\nthe senses) is the negative aspect of Upavasa. To engage\nthe mind in spiritual pastimes and thus foster\n'wakefulness to Hari' (Hari jagara) is the positive aspect.\nWhen both these ingredients are present, we then\nhave a truly fulfilling Upavasa.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

We were only too keen to offer the first\nattempt of ice-cream to H.H. The ice-cream was till\nthen not known at all in Udipi.

So wearing a\npitambar, I started rolling it until the mixture inside\ngot thick and ready.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202425\nH.H. had then proceeded to Sri Shankarnarayan\nTemple for the evening to meet the laity of the place,\nand for the evening Puja.\nI filled a silver plate with the ice-cream and offered\nit to H.H. in the retiring room, at the temple premises.\nH.H. asked me whether I tasted it, which I said I\nwould, after His Holiness tried it, and quietly came\naway.\nBy the time, I reached the spot where the ice-\ncream box had been placed, all who were gathered\nthere, as were keen to taste the preparation for the\nfirst time, had savoured to the last, and the drum\npolished clean. Tears started welling in my eyes, but\nI was not prepared to cry in front of others. Hence\nI quietly moved into the Garbhagudi to hide my\ndisappointment behind the door frame.\nIn the meantime, H.H. divined the situation and\ntwo Bhatjis were sent to fetch me to His room. One\nof them slowly caught me by chance and led me in\nthe presence of the holy Prince. H.H. ordered me to\nsit on His Anushthan Manai (Devegyeve ceeCeeF&) and made\nme partake ice-cream from another plate which a\nBhatji had just procured, nearly half the quantity\nfrom His own plate.\nH.H. then casually asked what it was being called.\n\"Ice-cream\". He pinned on the word - \"I scream, eyes\nscream\". H.H. was beaming a sweet smile!! \"Guru\nMata's love\" was enchanting.\nTwelve years later, I visited Him in Bangalore. He\nwas effusing with loving eyes, enquired of me when\nI had arrived in Bangalore and that I could as well\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202426\nstay in the camp. And then as His car just started,\nHe suddenly asked me how was the Ice-cream.\nBhatjis, as well H.H., with a twinkle in His eyes\nroared with laughter.\nThe incident was minor, but H.H. could recall\nafter 12 years to make a joke of it. All those who had\ngathered there were only keen to share the joke.\nWhen I narrated the incident, everyone could\nshare in the happiness of the moment.\n2) Jokes on the spur of the moment\nWhilst H.H. was travelling to Udipi with retinue,\nSri Kadle Narayanrao and Baindur Ramdas Subrao\nnick-named Bai-Ra-Su (initial syllables) were also\ntravelling together. Whilst crossing rivers, the car\nand the members travelling in, used to be transported\non the \"Jungal\" (known then for the Bus ferry as\nused in Goa). Sri Kadle was standing in the fore part\nof the jungal. Suddenly, a big wave splashed over\nthe jungal and Sri Kadle got wet. Immediately, H.H.\nasked Sri Baindur, \"Ramdas, please rush to Narayan's\nside and hold him firmly\" and Bai-Ra-Su rushed to\nKadle's side to steady him. Bhatjis could understand\nthe meaning all right, and all smiled.\nH.H. meant as Kadle ((r)eCees) got wet. Bai-Ra-Su\n(towel) could dry him by embracing him. This\nincident was shared by Sujir Sundarmhant (my\nuncle), who was a part of H.H. retinue.\nSubtle jokes of this kind were quite common,\nand as these innocent jokes were not meant to hurt\nanyone, they were enjoyed by all.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

This has always been the tradition of\nofficial tours of our Guru-s in the past. When we\nconclude our Ashirvachan here today, our official\ntour will also have ended.\nVaidic Ashirvachan is intended to remove doubts\nfrom the minds of the listeners, the laity, strengthen\ntheir convictions and bless them with both material\nand spiritual prosperity. On our official tour, we\nhave given some 22 to 23 Addresses and wherever\nwe have gone, we have spoken on Dharma, Karma,\nBhakti and Jnana. But, in all our Ashirvachan, our\nemphasis has been on Bhakti and God-remembrance\nrather than Dharma, Jnana etc. You may have heard\nof the well-known story of Swami Vivekananda, who,\non his return to India from a successful lecture tour\nabroad, was asked by a devotee why he did not\nspeak here on our ancient culture, religion and\npreach to our people what he had preached to\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\n(Summary of the Ashirvachan delivered by\nHis Holiness at Madras on 26-1-1976)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202428\nforeigners abroad. His reply was that he did not feel\nit proper to preach to the people of this country\nabout Vaidic rites and rituals and Dharma etc., when\nthey were so much immersed in poverty and misery\nor tell them how they should worship, observe the\nscriptural rules etc. What they needed more was\nguidance on how they could overcome their miseries\nand wordly travails and attain happiness. This\nquotation of Swami Vivekananda is apt here and\nillustrates why the emphasis in all our Ashirvachans\nhas been more on the practical side of how the\nhouseholder can follow the path of Bhakti in his\nevery-day life through God-remembrance etc.\nMoreover, in present-day times and the hectic lives\nled by most people, few are interested in mere\nexpositions on what is Brahman, what is Kundalini\nShakti etc. Therefore, we have been speaking\neverywhere on how our people can follow simple\nrules of Dharma, Japa and Sadhana in their day-to-\nday life, whereby they can elevate their life as a\nwhole and march on the Godward path.\nFirstly, we should have faith in God. We do not\nalways retain a firm rocklike faith in God. Therefore,\nwe should first recognise that there is God, there is\nGuru, there is Dharma etc. Each one's Sadhana or\nspiritual effort depends on his own capacity. Who is\nthis God of whom we speak, whom we refer to as\nShakti, Brahma Tattwa, etc.,? He is one Paramatman,\none Divine Power who runs the whole universe, who\ncontrols our destinies and makes us perform both\ngood and 'bad\" deeds. The scriptures describe such\na Supreme Being thus - \"He is with form, He is\nwithout form; He is with attributes, He is attributelss;\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202429\nHe is an Eternal Power who is Beginningless and\nbeyond the confines of time and space; He is\nUniversal, Omnipresent, and even time and space\nare His creation, used by Him for His Divine sport.\"\nSuch a Divine Power should not be merely accepted\nby us as existing but should be realised within\nourselves, in our mind and heart. We cammt 'measure\nHim in terms of time and space as He is infinite. He\ncan be experienced by us in the fullness of spiritual\nexperience, no matter what path we pursue, for He\nis all, in all and beyond all. All paths are His and\nlead only to Him. In fact, He is very close to us,\nbeing within ourselves, much nearer to us than we\ncan even imagine. All our effort should be to attain\nsuch a Divine Power. We call him as Rama, Krishna,\nDattatreya etc. No doubt, these Avatars did take\nbirth on this earth to lead mankind to salvation.\nBut, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva were the names\nand forms that our ancients gave to the triple\nfunctions of the Supreme Being, namely, Creation,\nPreservation and Destruction which is taking place\nall the while. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva were\nthemselves children of Adi Shakti who were entrusted\nby Her with the three functions mentioned above,\nfor the sake of Her divine sport. Yet, Adi Shakti has\nHerself remained above and beyond this cycle of\ncreation, preservation and destruction.\nTo give an example, when a man wakes up from\ndeep sleep, he gradually becomes aware of his\nsurroundings, of his possessions like 'my cot,' 'my\nroom,' My house,' 'my people' and so on. Then,\nwhen he goes out of the house, his consciousness\nwidens as he identifies himself with the town or city\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202430\nwhere he lives, the country and the people with\nwhom he works or moves. The first awareness on\nwaking up is creation, the identification of oneself\nwith the wider world is preservation and going\nback to sleep and becoming \"dead\" to the world at\nlarge is destruction.  Thus, the cycle of waking up,\nmovement and going back to sleep goes on all the\ntime and symbolises creation, preservation and\ndestruction. It also illustrates how man forgets his\ntrue Self and gets himself involved in mundane\npursuits and activity.\nThere is another example. The newborn infant, if\nyou look at it, you will see is completely lost in its\nown bliss, unmindful of the rest of the world. A few\nmonths older, the infant becomes aware of his prized\npossessions like his mother, father, brothers, sisters,\nmilk bottle etc., and the sense of possessions and\n\"my-ness\" grows in him as he grows older. Later, in\nhis adult life, the person's vision is drawn mare and\nmore externally, on external objects and he\ncompletely forgets his inner Self? Why should he do\nthat? That is because, this is part of God's scheme\nof things for this creation of His. When God created\neach one of us, He sent us into this world to pursue\nour own individual destiny and the predestined\nfunctions and roles. However, if we realise this and\nknow that all our activity owes its driving power to\nthe Adi Shakti, we will have liberated ourselves from\nthe cycle of birth and death and attained our ultimate\ndestiny, namely, reunion with the Supreme Being\nfrom whom we have all emerged.\nIt is patent that we cannot realise God by mere\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202431\nritualistic worship, like visiting temples on Saturdays,\nobserving periodical fasts etc., without realising the\ntrue significance of these observances. It might no\ndoubt give us some temporary spiritual satisfaction\nthat we have done something but cannot grant us\nlasting spiritual experience. We can realise God only\nwithin ourselves and that too only through intense\nGod-remembrance. God reveals Himself to His devotee\nwhen the latter becomes desperate and hungers\nand pines for His Darshan as if it is a matter of life\nand death for him. But, that does not mean that\nwhatever little Sadhana we do is wasted. If not in\nthis life, in some future life it will help us to attain\nGod-realisation, when all our Sadhanas are bound\nto bear fruit. Because, the Brahma Tatwa is not\nsomething to be \"realised\" as such. It is already\nwithin us. All we have to do is to remove the veil\nfrom our inner vision and realise our true Self and\nall our Sadhanas are directed to this end.\nThe easiest path to attain God is the path of\nBhakti. Bhakti can take any form like offering of\ncoconuts, flowers etc., but, once again, these acts by\nthemselves do not grant as lasting peace of mind.\nThe mind remains restless and wayward. We should\nhave firm faith in the path shown to us by our\npreceptors and try to achieve concentration of mind\non our goal. Only then, will the restlessness of the\nmind cease. The nature of the human mind is such\nthat it does not allow us to sit still but if we, on our\npart, still the mind by keeping it occupied, it leaves\nas alone and allows us also to be still. So, all Sadhana\nis directed towards stilling the restless mind. The\neasiest way to do as is through Japa. To make a\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202432\nbeginning, it is enough if you devote even five minutes\nto sit in a fixed place, in a fixed position and at a\nfixed time every day and chant the Name of the\nLord. Don't worry if your mind darts here and there\nand thinks all sorts of `evil\" thoughts. There is a\nlimit to what you can record on a tape, likewise\nthere is a limit even to the extent to which one's\nmind can become wayward. Sooner or later, as you\ncontinue with your daily Japa, the mind will become\nstill and get attuned to the sweet Name of the Lord.\nAnd, when this happens, you will have achieved real\nmeditation. This is not our teaching alone, it is the\nadvice of our ancients also.\nYou should discipline your wayward mind and\nteach it to concentrate on God by keeping apart a\ncertain period of your day for His remembrance.\nSide by side with Japa, there are certain observances\nalso necessary. They are:\nFirstly, non-violence and non-killing. You should\nnot harm any living creature.\nSecondly, speak the Truth always. Do not utter\nfalsehood at any cost or for any benefit.\nThirdly, do not covet another's possessions, or\nbecome envious.\nFourthly, do not think ill of another or wish\nanother ill.\nFifthly, do not allow your-self to be carried away\nby worldly pleasures or sorrows but retain your\nequanimity under all circumstances and take\neverything that happens in your stride.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202433\nWe remember, His Holiness (Srimad\nAnandashram Swamiji) used to persuade the\ndevotees to chant Gayatri Japa at least five times a\nday. What he meant was that if you devote even this\nlittle time to God-remembrance regularly, daily, you\nwill not only have the satisfaction of pursuing\nSadhana but you will also, in the long run, train\nyour mind to think of God and, automatically, God-\nremembrance will increase. As for the 'asan' (posture)\nyou should adopt while sitting for Japa or meditation,\nit is for you to decide which position is most\ncomfortable, and then stick to that position daily\nwhile sitting for Japa. Pranayama is also helpful, not\nonly as a means of controlling the mind but also\npurifying ourselves through breath control. To help\nconcentration of mind on Him, we should dwell\nmentally on the attributes of our Ishta Devata, be\nHe Rama, Krishna or any other form, so that His\ncomposite image remains fixed inour mind. That is\nreal meditation. We should also be fired with\nresolution and determination to attain God in this\nlife itself. We should realise for ourselves what is\nDharma, what is Sadhana and achieve spiritual\nexperience in all its rich fulness. Dharma does not\nlie in performing miracles. Dharma lies in realising\nour oneness with the Supreme Being and, in making\nan effort in this direction, our ancient spiritual lore\nand culture can be of every help.\nWe tender at the Feet of Lord Bhavanishankar all\nyour devotion and pray to Him that He grants your\naspirations and Your prayers.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

We just want to go into the\nAttributeless and Formless'. But as long as there\nis the 'doing'and the 'experiencing' one has to act.\nSo, act with the intention of connecting to the\nDivine. Our Worship of the Divine is not simply a\nritual. Through it we identify with the Divine and\ngo towards it. We Worship the Divine with the Non-\ndual Absolute as the Goal. It is not with the intent\nto gain some powers to raise money, or do\nsomething like that. So, the goal will determine\nwhether your upasana is pure or if it is corrupt\nor of little consequence.

Then you may accept\nHim only in this one form. But with growing\nconcentration, pray to Ishwara Himself - This is all\na web of Maya. You are beyond any form. If you\nare restricted to the Form, then you become\nlimited. Then your indivisibility has succumbed to\ndivision. This I will not accept. Your very nature is\nof one Integral Whole in which I too am a miniscule\nelement and I want to melt into that Whole. I don't\neven want to maintain my individuality. With that\nconviction we do the upasana of Lord\nBhavanishankara. So, the insistence on rupa is not\n...needed. At the same time, take the Form as a\nsupport and then pray to Ishwara - Give me the\nknowledge of Your Real nature also which is\nbeyond this form. So, with the objective, we do the\nchintana, the inquiry into the Stuti, the Shiva-\nMahimna-Stotra here.\n- Shirali 2022\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202437\nSignificance and purpose of chanting stotras\nYou see, we follow the Advaita Vedanta\nphilosophy. To recognize \"Oneself\" is our goal in\nlife. People study Vedanta also. If you have the\nnecessary qualifications, then direct and instant\nunderstanding that \"I am Brahman\" is possible. But\nthe intrinsic quality of our Parampara is that - the\nGuidance we receive - whether from a stotra or\nfrom a bhajana, is always Vedanta oriented. The\nbhajanas etc., that we sing with fervor, we then go\nonto contemplate upon them and the same concepts\nslowly begin to reveal themselves. We receive\nGuidance. This way we grasp this knowledge.\nStotras, without a doubt, helps to worship the\nAradhya-Devata describing the form, contemplation\nand eventually establishing \"Oneness\" which is their\nsole purpose. The significance of these stotras.\n- Shankarlok 2023\nUnderstanding our culture -\na perspective for the younger generation\nDeejesnCeced Dee!eAceCeb peerJelees peerJelees De3eveced\nThis is a Vaidika Mantra which we teach the\nyounger generation. So, what does Swamiji want?\nPlease understand. You understand Arohana, to\nascend. A child ascends. He comes to the third\nstandard. He now must go to the fourth. If he does\nnot pass? He was not able to move up. You ascend,\nwhatever level you may have reached - there you\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202438\nsurvey all around and then get to the crux, towards\nprogress - that is what is akramanam. That is the\nunderstanding of our culture. You learn, you\nunderstand, and you stabilize that knowledge. Not\nlike - I have heard something, I understood and\nwhen I am asked about it ... then I am not able\nto verbalize. It must be assimilated. That knowledge\nmust be assimilated and converted to conviction so\nthat I can experiment with it. This is Saraswat\nculture. We must ascend and progress in this\nmanner. Having understood the culture, we then\nexpress it correctly. Or else understand and then\nassimilate it. As action or as upasana, if you want\nto increase that, then definitely do so. We insist\non this element.\n- Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 2022\nEka Tattva Nanatva Rupa - Distinct Flavor of\nOur Saraswat Culture\nWhen the Devata is worshipped, for example\nShiva, He loves Abhisheka. There is chanting of the\nRudra, or chant japa of 'Om Namah Shivaya, Om\nNamah Shivaya.' Or while chanting a Shiva Stotra,\nthe abhisheka is performed. With this Shiva is\npleased. He is pleased if Bhasma (ashes) or wild\nflowers or bel leaves are offered. This is a sequence\nwhich that Devata accepts with certainty. That is\nwhen you are showered with His complete Grace.\nWhen Vishnu or Krishna Bhagwan is propitiated\nwith Tulasi. Where? She is revered in the front\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202439\ncourtyard. When worshipped with a sprig of Tulasi,\nHe is pleased. Hence some distinction should be\nmaintained. Do you understand? Getting everything\nmixed up is not acceptable. You will not enjoy it\nthen. There is beauty even in diversity. This flavor\nis distinct. This has a unique taste. In the same\nmanner, for whose sake does This One Essence\n(Tattva) appear in myriad of forms (rupa)? For the\nBhakta. One revered Acharya said, \"bhaktyartham\nkalpitam dvaitam advaitadapi sundaram.\" This is the\nknowledge of Advaita (Non-dual). Ishwara pervades\neverywhere. This kind of knowledge is difficult to\nabsorb. So, what do we do? We accept God\n(Ishwara)in one manifested form of our Ishta-Devata.\nSo, when we propitiate the Ishta-Devata, we give the\nsame offerings that are acceptable to Him which He\nenjoys. Ganapati is offered the sweet\nmodakas(laddu) which He loves. Sweets and Durva\nare offered. Then we know ... yes. That is when the\nimpressions are embedded and we start feeling the\nconnection. When you see Durva, you know\nGanapati is worshipped. The moment you see Bel\nleaves, Shiva is being worshipped while Tulasi\nmeans Krishna is being propitiated. We begin to\nunderstand and connecting becomes easy. If you\ndo not understand, you just do not. Just like you\nwould not understand a language. Accepting this\nkind of diversity brings about an understanding of\nthe richness in our culture. The Divine can come\nin varied forms - recognize it. What will you call\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202440\nthis kind of culture? Literally Saraswat culture. You\nare all Saraswats, hence I am telling you. To\nidentify that One Tattva in all the many myriad\nforms, that is our culture.\n- Shri Dungargarh 2023\nInvoking Saraswati's Grace\nExcellent qualities and worthy thoughts should\nsurface and be expressed. Give me the competence\nto do that Devi! Such is the prayer of a Saraswat.\nA Saraswat is one who worships Saraswati. He is\nSaraswati's disciple. He is Saraswati's child. Which\nis why the term 'Saraswat.' Which is why he is\ncompletely entitled to say - \"Brahma meditated\nupon You so that He would be able to create. I am\nYours, and so I pray to You - 'saralam saraswatam\ndehi me yasya ammodam udirayanti pulakaih\nantargatah devatah' Then all the Divine forces\nwithin me will be roused awake and whether it is\nexpressing myself through speech, good thoughts,\nwriting or my actions in society, I will be able to\ndo them all because Saraswat's grace would have\nbegunto make an impact at every level. Make my\nlife resplendent in this way Devi.' Every Saraswat\nmay appeal to Her in this manner because he has\nthe right to do so.

Yama is a set of\nmental disciplines, the foremost of them being\nAhimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya and Asangraha\n(non-violence, truth-speaking, non-covetousness,\ncontinence and non-hoarding). Niyama is a set of\nphysical disciplines that form a part of one's personal\nroutine: worship, repetition of mantras, contentment\nin simple living, facing hardship with fortitude etc.\nThe next three steps of yoga refer to disciplines\nprescribed by yoga texts for the use of body, breath\nand senses respectively. These along with Yama and\nNiyama-form the foundations of any moral and social\nculture- and also form the five steps of preparations\nfor the ultimate realization of Yoga. The last three\nsteps -Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi are to be\nconsidered as one unit. forming the main body of\nYoga. Patanjali gives to this unit the name Samyama.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202445\nThese three steps signify concentration on a\nparticular object, entering into the reality of the\nobject, and finally becoming one with it by losing the\nobjectivity. When Samyama is applied to the ultimate\ngoal of life, which is the realization of the Soul-Truth,\nthe mind attains the perfect state of poise or nirodha\nwhere Brahman is comprehended.\nIt is significant that Dakshinamurti, and not the\nsadhaka, has been referred to here as being endowed\nwith the disciplines of Yoga, Because, the yoga-\nprocess is so subtle and subjective that Yoga texts\nthemselves declare: \"It is not possible to learn Yoga\nby external means. Yoga should be learnt by Yoga.\"\nAcharya Sureshvara states: \"Guru's grace alone can\ngive you the Ashtanga Yoga.\" Therefore,\nDakshinamurti comes to us as the Yogamurti to\ndemonstrate and deliver yoga to us.\n61) 3eefleaHeOejes ceewveer e\nThe silent one in the garb of a monk.\n62) 3eleerveesHeem3eefJeuen e\nWhose form is adored by the foremost among the\nmonks. These two names present Dakshnamurti as\na Yati or Sanyasi (monk). As referred to in the\nintroduction, the nivrtti-parampara has sprung from\nHim. Only a sannyasi can initiate another into\nSannyasa. Therefore in giving the initiation to\nSanatkumara, in the beginning of creation,\nDakshinamurti appears as Yatirupadhara. The\npravrtti-parampara of Brahma-vidya is traced to\nBhagvan Narayana. It went to Brahma, Vasishta etc.\nthrough the father-son lineage (Heg$e-HejcHeje), but even\nin this Shuka the son of Vyasa turned out to be an\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202446\nall-renouncing avadhuta; and thus the tradition of\nenlightenment after him turned into nivrtti-\nparampara, in which Gaudapada appears as an\nillustrious figure. He directly influenced and inspired\nhis grand-disciple Acharya Shankara, who is\nconsidered an avatara of Dakshinamurti. The name\nYatirupadhara may easily be attributed to Shankara\nhimself instead of to Dakshinanurti. To avoid this the\nadjective Mauna (the silent one) is given. Shankara,\nas we all know, was a prolific preacher and hence\nmukhara. In name sixty-two, the 'Yatindra may be\ntaken as a general reference to all heads of Sannyasi\ntraditions, or may refer in particular to Acharya\nShankara. This is more fitting, because it was Acharya\nShankara who revived Dakshinamurti tradition of\nUpasana. Secondly, he argued most eloquently and\nemphatically to prove the necessity of Sannyasa, for\nthe attainment of liberation. Without doubt,\nShankara is the Yatindra of our age.\n63) cevoejnej(c)ef(r)ej e\nAdorned with garlands of Mandara flowers.\n64) ceovee3eglemegvoj e\nWith the beauty of ten-thousand Cupids.\n65) cevoeqmceleuemeUJeI$e e\nWith the tender smile playing on his face.\n66) ceOegjeOejHeuueJe e\nWhose lower lip is sweetly beautiful.\n67) cebpeerjcebpegHeeoeype :\nWhose lovely lotus feet are decorated with anklets.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202447\n68) ceefCeHeAEesuemeledJeAefi :\nHe who wears a belt of gems around his waist.\nThe present six names describe the divine forms\nof the Lord in such a way as to dispel the idea that\nHis monasticism involves sack-cloth and ashes or any\nsuch disfiguring self-torture. He is seen here endowed\nwith majestic beauty and splendour of body, mind\nand soul. This alone makes his tyaga dynamic and\nmeaningful. When the capacity and chance for\nenjoyment are not there, the giving up of that\nenjoyment is a farce or a frustration. In the Vedic\nconcept, both nivratti and pravratti are natural paths\nof human progress that open out through an\nunderstanding of life's values and not because of\nstress and strain of a depravity within and without.\nThe 'mandasmita' of name sixty-five may be connected\nwith the 'darahasa' of name thirty-eight in order to\nget a comparison of two Vedic paths.\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sorovar, Mt.

Uma & Shri Arun S. Bolangdy.\nUNFORGETABLE REMINISCENCES\n- LATE SHRI A. V. SHANKAR RAO\nNow, I shall briefly recount some of the incidents\nwhich have made a deep impression on my mind.\nI was one of the party when Sri Swamiji visited\nKumara Parvata, a hill ten miles from Subrahmanya\nin South Kanara in the year 1943. The terrain\nthrough which we had to pass was covered with\ngrass as sharp as Kusha and over a man's height.\nThe path had to be cut in advance by the tribal\npeople there. Though the distance was hardly ten\nmiles, it took as many hours to cover it, with just\none place in middle which offered shelter and\nreservoir of water Should one miss the track by\nlagging behind, it was almost impossible for him to\nfind his way to rejoin the party. I happened to have\nthis experience. I could not fmd my way or trace\nwhither the party had proceeded I felt, I was lost. I\nprayed to Him. Sri Swamiji discovered that I was\nmissing after a short distance had been covered by\nthem and just at the place of shelter referred to\nabove. He sent some persons in search of me. They\nwere able to spot me and take me to the place where\nthe party was resting. I am reminded here of the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam June 20248\nparable of the lost sheep in the Bible.\nI have heard a number of persons while giving\nexpression to a feeling of the benign influence of Sri\nSwamiji in their direst moments of tribulations.\nA friend of mine, (I should not omit to mention\nhis name) Kallianpur Rama Rao of Ahmedabad, was\nin charge of the entire arrangements for the reception\nof Sri Swamiji and party during His last official visit\nto that place. He got very little assistance from others.\nRain was pouring. Rama Rao felt almost desperate.\nSri Swamiji appeared before Him in his dream and\nblessed him saying that everything would go off\nwell. Truly so, the rain stopped; assistance came to\nhim from unexpected quarters and the entire\nfunction went off very nicely.\nAnother friend of mine, a doctor, had an attack\nof typhoid and was almost on his deathbed. He saw\nin a half awake and half dreamy state Sri Swamiji\nappearing before him and blessing him. From then\nonwards he began to improve and recovered\ncompletely.\nAn old Bhatiji, who was reluctant to undergo an\noperation but without which he could not survive,\nhad a pleasant dream in which he saw Sri Swamiji\nblessing him. This gave him courage to agree to have\nthe operation. He recovered and is quite healthy to\nthis day. A relation of mine who was to be operated\nfor a throat ailment had a similar experience. I have\npersonally had experience of the same kind years\nago.\nThere are very many instances of this kind but\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam June 20249\nspace forbids me to detail them. When we mention\nthese to Sri Swamiji, He simply brushed them\naside saying, \"It is all due to the grace of the\nAlmighty.\" What humility!\nWhen I think of His humility, the question always\narises in my mind why Sri Swamiji does not own the\ngreatness that He possesses. Is this humility\nreconcilable with our actual experience? Or is it that\nall qualities which are seemingly irreconcilable are\npresent in Him who is one with God?\nIn the year 1941, Sri Swamiji planned a trip to\nTiruvannamalai where there is the famous shrine of\nArunachaleshwar. I was fortunate to be one of the\nparty. Manjeshwar Ananthanarayan Rao had just\nthen completed the construction of his house in this\nplace. He placed it at the disposal of Sri Swamiji. We\nvisited the temple and, the next morning, went round\nthe hill, Arunagiri, covering a distance of about 8\nmiles. Tradition says that, this hill is the Ishwara\nLinga itself. Sri Swamiji started on bare feet and the\nwhole party followed suit. In the forenoon,\nAnanthanarayan Rao, an ardent devotee of Sri\nRamana Maharshi, proposed that he should be\npermitted to arrange a meeting of Sri Swamiji with\nthe Maharshi. Sri Swamiji agreed. The meeting was\narranged. Then arose the question in the mind of\nAnanthanarayan Rao as to who of them should first\npay obeisance to the other, and he mooted it with\nme. I was equally nonplussed. But, at the same\ntime, I assured him that everything would go off\nwell. As scheduled, Sri Swamiji was escorted to the\nAshram at 10 a.m. Unusually, the Maharshi left his\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam June 202410\nseat and went out just before Sri Swamiji arrived\nthere, was taken in and seated on a specially\narranged seat in front of the divan on which the\nMaharshi was accustomed to sit reclining, facing his\ndevotees. Just after Sri Swamiji was seated, the\nMaharshi entered the hall beckoning to Sri Swamiji\nto continue to be seated and himself took his seat\non the divan. Contrary to his habit of reclining, he\nturned towards Sri Swamiji and for nearly an hour\nthe two saints sat gazing at each other. Perceptibly\nthe two saints were in communion with each other\nwithout a word being uttered. Both then got up\nsimultaneously with folded hands. Sri Swamiji turned\nand came out. Thus ended a momentous meeting of\nthe two saints.\nMost of the devotees of the Maharshi came to Sri\nSwamiji's camp and paid their homage. One among\nthem, Mr. Dorairaja Mudaliar, the then Public\nProsecutor of Chittor, told me that during 30 years\nof his visits to Ramanashram almost weekly, he had\nnever witnessed the type of response of the Maharshi\nto any one, and exclaimed that Sri Swamiji must be\na great saint and that our community must be very\nfortunate in having Him as our Guru.\nThe trip to Srisailam in the year 1948 was as\nstrenuous as the one to Kumara Parvata; but the\npower of endurance of Sri Swamiji was quite evident\nduring that visit. After a strenuous journey from\nPeddascheruvu (up to where the car could go) to\nSrisailam, Sri Swamiji went down to the Patalaganga,\nhundreds of steps below and, after a bath there,\ncame up to the Mallikarjuna Temple and had a quiet\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam June 202411\npuja for about an hour.\nThe devotion and complete concentration with\nwhich the puja was performed was witnessed by me\non another occasion when we visited Sri\nAkhiLandeshwari Temple during the last South\nIndian pilgrimage. The garbhagriha had absolutely\nno ventilation. Sri Swamiji was perspiring profusely\nand would not take a seat though offered. All the\ntime Sri Swamiji stood in deep meditation.\nI can certainly multiply instances where the divine\nqualities of Sri Swamiji have made a deep impression\non my mind. However, I should not omit to\nmention the two great precepts which He has\nbeen always stressing: One is \"Bear no ill-will\ntowards anybody whatever he may do.\"(efveJezj: meJe&Yetles<eg\n3e:me ceecesefle)the other is \"Do your duty and surrender\nyourself completely to the Parmataman\" (meJe&Oecee&ved\nHeefjl3ep3e ceeceskebA MejCeb Je'pe). I conclude with fervent prayer\nto Him to grant us vairagya, bhakti and jnana, to\nshed His kindly light for us to tread the path of\nrighteousness, and to give us courage to bear the\ntribulations of this evanescent world with equanimity.\nDemelees cee meoddiece3e ~ lecemees cee p3eesefleie&ce3e ~\nceal3eescee& Decealeb iece3e ~\n~~ ss Meeeqvle: Meeeqvle: Meeeqvle:~~\n(Courtesy : Fifty Years of Bliss and Sunbeam, August 1982)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

After giving\nso much attention to his body and his physical\npleasures, what has he really attained in the end?\nMan should realise that his human birth and\nwhatever experiences befall him are the fruits of\npast actions. Once he realises what is Brahman\n(God) and Bhrama (illusion), what is Truth and what\nis Unreal, he will have made his life worthwhile.\nThe Scriptures tell us that we should meditate\non Him daily if we want to atttain Him. The path to\nHim lies in that constant contemplation of the\nEternal. Lord Krishna says in the Gita:\nDeelcewJe ?eelcevees yebOegjelcewJe efjHegjelceve: ~\nBut, in today's world, man says he has attained\nhappiness in the morning and can be seen working\nfor that happiness again in the afternoon and again\nat night! That is why it is said that happiness is of\ntwo kinds - the real happiness and the shadow of\nhappiness with no substance whatsoever. Illusory\nhappiness gives you a temporary sensation of joy. It\nis for us to use our power of reasoning to know that\nsuch illusory joys do not constitute happiness. This\npower of reasoning has not been given to the animals.\nGod is so kind that He has given this power only to\nthe human being, so that he might find out for\nhimself what kind of happiness is true and lasting,\nso that he may not descend to the level of beasts.\nThe Scriptures tell us that Brahman is real, Jagat\nis unreal (ye'ie mel3eb peieved efceL3ee). All our objects of pleasure\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam June 202414\nthat lie outside us, our wife, children, families, worldly\npossessions we take for real and we cling to them,\nthen how can such a man regard the world as unreal.\nAs a new-born, until he is two months or so, a child\nknows only three things in the world, namely, its\nmaternal ties, the sense of thirst and the desire to\ncry. Except for this, the little infant is lost in himself,\nlost to the world at large. As he grows a little older,\nhowever, he starts hugging the world or the world\nat large starts hugging him. He starts recognising\nhis maternal and paternal relations, his cradle, his\nmilk-bottle etc., and if he does not get these articles\nof his desire, he knows also how to cry for them.\nThat is how man, at an early age, starts experiencing\npleasure and pain, all born of external objects. He\nturns his back on his real Self, in which he was lost\nin his infancy. When one sleeps, he forgets all his\nlikes and dislikes, love and hatreds, he forgets\neverything that has attracted or repelled him. This\nonly proves that whatever we see outside ourselves\nis only a play of the mind This sort of temporary\npleasure is all right for those who want only such\npleasure and ask for nothing else. But, those who\nare dissatisfied with the transitoriness of such\npleasures should begin to turn their mind inside, to\ngrasp once again at that blissful state of communion\nwith Him that was theirs as very small infants.\nThat is why Krishna says that the self is one's\nown friend and the self is one's own adversary. It\nonly means that if without turning your vision inside,\nyou concentrate only on external objects, you prove\nto be your own enemy whereas if you look within,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam June 202415\nyou attain Atma Tatva (Self-realisation).\nThe doors of Liberation (Moksha), it is said, are\nopened by saints. Who is a saint? How can one be\na saint? There are certain people who, one might\nsay, are constitutionally incapable of walking on the\npath of saints or attaining that supreme state, people\nwho are so crooked that they cannot even think of\nGod. But, those who want to turn their minds towards\nGod can become saints. Once they feel the desire to\nbecome servants of God, they start walking on the\npath of saints, they start rising above body-\nconsciousness. They begin to realise that the seeds\nof joy as well as sorrow lie in themselves. Human\nnature, however, is such that if one feels any pain\nor misery, he immediately looks around for someone\non whom the blame can be thrown. Man should\nrealise that he should undergo whatever falls to his\nlot with equanimity, without blaming it on any\nexternal objects or creature. Its cause lies in himself\nonly and he should not think ill of anyone.\nHe is a saint who always thinks well of others.\nAll are different from you only in form, but really\nspeaking are not different from you. A man who\nwants to be a Sadhu should be at peace with\neveryone else. A Sadhu should not be an enemy to\nanyone, he should regard everyone as his friend, no\nmatter how others regard him. He must look on\neveryone as his very own.\nHow to recognise a Sadhu?

In this state, Krishna tells us, the Sadhu \"thinks\nand hears only of Me, speaks to others only of Me\nand sings only My glories.\" Such a person is never\nharassed by passing tribulations. He is always lost\nin the thought of God, and looks on all as forms of\nhis beloved God.\nOne thing you must all keep in mind always: we\nare here to realise our true Being and this is the\nonly purpose of life. And, once we have attained\nGod, once we have established ourselves in the\nhappiness of knowing God, nothing can dislodge us\nfrom that state. Let us surrender to Him who is all\nand all in all, who is known as Krishna, Brahma or\nby any other Name.

We merely\nconcurred in the suggestion made by leaders of our\ncommunity that, if differences of opinion within the\nCommunity should recede and the Community\nshould advance, such reforms were essential.\nAlthough, in practice, we are being termed\nChitrapnr Saraswats, all of us belonged to one\nsingle Community at the source. It appears from\nold documents that, our people formerly described\nthemselves as the \"Gowd Saraswat Brahmana Ten.\"\nAlthough the Gowd Saraswat Community was thus\none, difference in tradition and in the territory of\noccupation created different sections among them.\nInter-dining and inter-marriage also ceased.\nThereafter, when the Ekikaran movement was started\na few years ago, amongst those who opposed it, our\nMath too was one.

Uma & Shri Arun S. Bolangdy.\nINTER-MARRIAGES AMONGST GOWD\nSARASWAT SUB-SECTS\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 20236\nas it led to differences in the Community, but we\nalso suggested removal of the ban on both inter-\ndining and inter-marriage as well. Later, when we\nwere at Madras in 1929, on the occasion of a reception\nby the local Samyukta Gowd Saraswat Sabha, Dr. C.\nRama Kamath suggested, in the course of his speech,\nthat it was desirable that the different subsects of\nGowd Saraswat Brahmanas should resort not only\nto inter-dining but also to inter-marriage, and that\nDharma-Gurus might give the necessary inspiration\nto the people in this regard. To this we replied that\nour Math had already given its concurrence on this\npoint as stated above. Later still, in 1941, we extended\nthis principle to some extent and made it clear that,\nif marriages took place between members of our\nCommunity and those of the ten classes of\nBrahmanas, the Math would take no exception. On\nthe whole, credit for this reform belongs only to\nleaders of the Community.\nIn the speech now delivered by Shri Dwarakanath\nTirtha Swamiji, He has instructed students at length\nthat they should go in for plain living devoid of bad\nhabits and embodying high thinking, that they\nshould have a passion for study and for the service\nof the feet of the Lord, instead of a passion for bidis,\ncigarettes and the like. Hence it is not necessary for\nus to say much on this subject. As, according to the\nConstitution, ours is a secular State, it is not cleat\nhow far religious instruction can be imparted in\nGovernment-aided schools. Nevertheless, it is\nessential to instil faith in God and adherence to\nDharma in the hearts of children at a tender age.\nHence we feel that Government restrictions will not\ncome in the way if students are taught at least the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 20237\nprinciples inherent in all religions, namely, that\nthere is a Lord who controls this Universe; that, by\nHis grace, we can achieve success in this life and\nspiritual happiness and peace; that one should,\naccordingly, seek shelter in Him and be devoted to\nHim, and should also practise values like truth,\nnon-violence, etc. Through such values and the feeling\nwhich is part of devotion to the Lord, namely, that\nHe himself abides in the hearts of all, individual\nuplift will take place, differences and disputes in\nsociety will diminish, love and friendship will increase,\nand solidarity and peace will result. As we understand\nthat attempts at religious instruction have been made\nin this school from earlier times, we suggest that\nthey should be kept up to the extent possible in\nfuture as well.\nYou have stated in the Address that the late\nArnembal Subba Rao Pai, the founder of this school,\nadvocated and worked for the unification of sub-\nsects of the Gowd Saraswat Community. Today's\nprogramme of reception to the two Mathadhipatis\nappears to have been arranged with that object of\nhis mainly in view. We conclude this little speech\nwith a prayer to the Paramatma that your object\nmay be fulfilled, that mutual love, friendship and\nfeeling of oneness amongst the sub-sects of the\nGowd Saraswat Community may grow, that all may\nderive the benefit arising from such solidarity, and\nthat He may bless you accordingly.\n(Summary of the Ashirvachan delivered at the\nCarrara High School, Mangalore,\non 23rd February, 1956.)","type":"Document"}

It has not left unsolved a single problem\npertaining to the conduct of human life, both in its\nspiritual and physical spheres. For the highest truths\nof philosophy and also for a perfect light on practical\nside of life, one has to go to this great work. The\nmessage of the entire Gita is to reveal the harmony\nand identity of the soul with God and of God with\nNature.\nIt must be within the experience of every student\nof the Gita that the majority of the commentators on\nthis great scripture have drawn out such truths from\nit as would coincide with their own views and\npredilections, and have presented them to the world\nas the whole secret of this many-sided and all\ncomprehensive mine of Wisdom. Some read into the\nGita an emphatic call to renounce all action in the\nworld as the ultimate goal. Some others argue that\nthe Gita holds devotion to a personal God as the\nessential creed of it. Some would have it that the\nGita urges the soul to plunge into action, making\nthat alone the sole criterion and the one necessary\ncondition of human existence. Again some others,\ntaking the Mahabharata war including the Gita as\nonly an allegorical exposition of the eternal truths,\ninterpret the teachings from their viewpoint as\nembodying an uncompromising cult of Ahimsa. Each\none of these expounders of the Gita is right from the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202317\nangle of vision by which he has struggled to\nunderstand the scripture. But the whole truth\nenshrined in its eighteen chapters is all that they\nhave said put together and much more besides. For\nan all-round authoritative, conclusive and\ncomprehensive treatise on the Gita, among the\ncommentaries of the present day, one has to turn to\nthe illuminating and inspiring volumes of \"The Essays\non the Gita\" by Sri Aurobindo.\nTo understand life and realise its glory integrally,\none has to study the Gita in all its phases and from\nall standpoints. To have a partial view of a particular\naspect of it alone, and to hold forth that as the\nwhole truth, has been the cause of imperfection in\nspiritual experience.\nThe purpose of the Gita is to proclaim that human\nlife is essentially Divine-spiritually, mentally and\nphysicatty. Its one aim is to prove that spirit and\nmatter are one and the same, Activity in the world,\nwhatever form it might take, as circumstances and\nconditions demand, is not a thing to be shunned or\nrenounced. What is needed is to divinise Life through\nthe attainment of freedom from the individuat sense\nby the emergence of it into God, who is at once the\nsoul, the universe and the all-transcendent and all-\ninclusive Truth.\nThe soul whose life is thus liberated, the Gita\nsays, is utterly Divine in all his movements --\nsignificant as well as insignificant. Now action for\nhim is but a natural and spontaneous flow of Divine\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202318\nenergy acting through him. As God's supreme will\ndetermines, this energy works through him equally\nto create, to preserve and to destroy. Since this\nillumined personality intuitively bases his actions\non the vision of the universal Reality and performs\nthem in a state entirely bereft of the individual\nsense, they do not affect him for good or evil. So\nlong as the soul misses this acme o attainment, he\nflounders in the morass of conflicting dualities --\ngood and evil, virtue and sin, Ahimsa and Hinsa and\npleasure and pain.\nThe Divine Shakti works in the universe both for\nconstructive and destructive purposes. Only when\nthe  Supreme Power acts in man, through his lower\nnature, it is vitiated with greed, lust and selfishness.\nIn this state, in whatever manner he acts, his works\nare tainted. For personal aggrandisement, such as\nfor  wealth, power and glory, he would launch into\nany kind of action irrespective of its nature as Ahimsa\nor  Himsa. Whereas the same Shakti when She acts\nin a man, freed entirely from every egoistic impulse\nor ambition, does so for the uplift and protection of\nthe oppressed and innocent humanity. Here Shakti\nmay  work through the purified medium or vehicle,\ncreatively or destructively. Creation and destruction\nare concomitant movements. We can never separate\nthem. Every new creation has at its basis the\ndestruction of the old. This is the law of Nature\nuniversally applicable. We cannot palliate, shirk or\nignore this law of God controlling all the activities of\nNature, including those of human beings. It is ever\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202319\nthere, facing us at every turn. The saving grace for\nman, in the field of action, lies only in his acting as\nan instrument of the Divine -- in a state of utter\nfreedom from the touch and recoil of action. Here,\nwhat is essential is complete dedication of life's\nactions to the will and power of the Almighty, dwelling\nin the hearts of all beings, creatures and things.\nElse, if we move only in the vicious circle of harassing\nDwandwas -- good and evil -- and attempt to cling\nto one of them for attainment of true freedom and\npeace, we can never reach the goal. Doubts and\nfears will ever rise in the mind of such a man, and\nhe will become a scared creature, always a prey to\nimpatience, suspicion and despair. Therefore, the\ncommand of Sri Krishna is: \"Rise beyond the dualities,\nrise beyond the Dharmas of the Gunas, i.e. rise\nbeyond all conditioned states of existence, conceived\nof and set up as standards by the fettered mind and\nintellect, and be one with Me -- the all-transcendent\nReality -- and then act in life as My instrument, as\nMy Vibhuti -- Myself revealed in and as your form\nand body. This is the deliverance that I offer you;\nthis is the supreme blessedness in which I grant\nyou the bliss of immortality.\"\nSpontaneity of life born of an egoless purity and\ninnocence, and a consciousness of immortal freedom\nand a condition of perfect Divine ecstasy and peace\nis the one supreme note and refrain of the Voice\nthat rings though the Gita.\n(Courtesy: The Vision)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

The experience was even more\npalpable and rewarding when after a four-year\npause owing to the pandemic, the 7- day Kara Seva\nShibir took place in Shirali from 7th to 14th May\n2023.\nA shibir where new friendships were forged and\nexisting ones cemented, new memories were etched\ninto the minds of the shibirarthi-s while\nparticipating in the sessions and interacting with\nour Beloved Guru H.H. Shrimat Sadyojat\nShankarashram Swamiji. On the day of arrival, the\nshibirarthi-s were gently initiated into the program\nwith the registration, a briefing, and an icebreaker\nsession which got all the participants excited for the\nweek to follow. The shibirarthi-s were split into 5\ngroups which by the end of the shibir served to\nbuild unity and friendship among them. Dipa-\nprajwalana was performed to indicate the initiation\nof the Shibir and Pratijna was taken by all\nshibirarthi-s to signify their commitment in the\nDivine presence of H.H. Swamiji. After this, our\nsenior sanchalaka-s briefed the yuva-s about the\nShrines and the Mahasamadhi Sannidhi-s within\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202323\nthe temple. They were also shown other vital\nstructures of our Math, like the Dhwaja Stambha,\nShivaganga Sarovara, Goshala and so on. This was\nday 1 and it left the yuva-s and upasanchalaka-s\nwanting more. The following days were packed with\nactivities and sessions and the shibirarthi-s found\nthemselves following a busy schedule over the next\n7 days. Wake up time was at 5am and the\nshibirarthi-s would freshen up and assemble by\n6am  for warm up sessions post tea.\nShri Balakrishna Shetty's session:\nThe first exercise session of the shibir was\nconducted by Shri Balakrishna Shetty - known to\nus as Bala maam, as he has been closely associated\nwith the Math and shibir-s for many years. He is\nan 8-times national Muay Thai champion and a\nJujitsu and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter. He\nruns the Total Combat Fitness centre in Mumbai\nwhich advocates mixed workouts and MMA classes.\nHe spoke about ancient schools of martial arts in\nIndia and had a wealth of knowledge to share about\nmartial arts and fighting techniques. He displayed\na few such self-defence techniques followed by a\nwarm up session that invigorated the shibirarthi-\ns for the kara seva activities that were to follow.\nKara seva sessions:\nThe most awaited activity would take place in the\nmorning. The shibirarthi-s would eagerly get onto\nthe bus at 6:30am which took them to Kembre\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202324\nfarms, accompanied by sanchalaka-s. One of the\nfield activities required the shibirathi-s to shovel\ndried leaves into baskets and spread them evenly\nonto the fields which would then serve as manure.\nAnother activity included, cleaning a pond which\nwas clogged with silt, mud and leaves. This is\nrequired to be done before every monsoon so that\nthe pond has sufficient depth to collect rain water\nthrough the season. This activity continued over the\nnext 3-4 mornings and by the end of the fourth\nday the youngsters had enjoyed this activity so\nmuch that some happily talked about how they had\nshed their inhibitions of getting into the water and\nsome were hesitant to come out of the water when\nit was time to get back! It's not everyday that one\ngets to do farm activities like these. After a good\nwash the shibirarthi-s were treated to freshly peeled\njackfruit that tasted like no other produce\nelsewhere, along with local mangoes, bananas and\nother snacks.\nCarpentry sessions:\nShibirarthi-s in group-wise rotation participated\nwholeheartedly in a 2-hour session of carpentry\nwith Harin Hattangadi mam and a few sanchalaka-\ns who volunteered to help. The carpentry lab of\nSrivali High School is an elaborately stocked\nworkplace with all possible hand-held tools and\nmachines that makes carpentry an extremely\nfruitful and rewarding experience. Shibirarthi-s\nwould come back from the session with a product\nentirely made by them - labelled with their names\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202325\nof course. From key holders to clothes hangers, the\nshibirarthi-s had a choice of products to make\nunder supervision and using safety gear.\nPranayama and Ninada sessions:\nThese sessions were conducted by Sharayu\nHaldipur pachi who emphasised that these\nPranayama and Ninada techniques are a 'Prasada'\nfrom our beloved Guru H.H. Shrimat Sadyojat\nShankarashram Swamiji. Devised by H.H. Swamiji\nHimself, these extremely effective breathing\nexercises are simple to follow. Techniques like\nKapalabhati, Bhastrika with Kumbhaka and Ninada\nwere taught at a calm and relaxing pace by Sharayu\npachi. The shibirarthi-s said that these techniques\nwere one of the key take-aways from the shibir.\nSanskrit Sambhashana (Spoken Sanskrit):\nSanskrit is one of the oldest living languages and\nlearning it brings an array of benefits. Sanskrit can\nbe taught and learnt in a fun and simple way, was\nwhat Shilpa Mudur pachi and Sangita Pawar pachi\nbrought forth with their session on Sanskrit\nSambhashana. Shibirarthi-s felt it was a much\nsimpler and an exciting way to learn than how it\nis usually taught in school. With this session being\nan eye-opener, a few of them felt eager enough to\nenroll for the Sanskrit Sambhashana class\n(Girvanapratishtha - Girvanavaikhari course).\nGuruparampara sessions:\nOur Guruparampara is rich and vast as elucidated\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202326\nin the book 'Shri Chitrapur Guruparampara\nCharitra'. These 1-hour sessions were spread over\n3 days and the speakers of the session (Shivani\nKallianpur pachi and Vinaya Nadkarni pachi) shared\nexcerpts from the revered text. With the help of\nstories that enrich our history, they made a\npresentation filled with pictures, which the\nshibirarthi-s appreciated and answered the quiz at\nthe end of every session enthusiastically. By the\nend of the shibir, the participants felt truly blessed\nto be connected to such a glorious Guruparampara,\nblessed with the Anugraha of 11 Guru-s.\nCareers in Defence:\nWith most of the shibirarthi-s just graduating from\nschool and college and eager to meet the world\noutside, it was essential to enlighten the yuva-s on\ncareer opportunities and life in service of our\ncountry. Captain Chinmay Kallianpur, conducted a\nsession on opportunities in the Defence Services,\nhighlighting the scope of work in the Indian Navy.\nThe presentations included videos showcasing\nadvanced engineering, various job profiles, and\neligibility options. The session did more than just\npique the interest of the shibiarathi-s, who watched\nthe presentation with rapt attention.\nImportance of Cyber Security:\nA much-needed session on cyber security by\nTanmay Mudur maam was an eye opener for all.\nThe various categories of cyber crime and a detailed\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202327\nlist of solutions on how to avoid becoming a victim\nof cyber crime was brought out in these sessions.\nOur young audience could relate easily to what was\nbeing discussed, given the usage of social media\nand online payments. Tanmay Mudur maam is\nassociated with the cyber security team of SVC\nBank.\nChaturmasa 2023:\nThe convenor for the Chaturmas 2023 - Satish\nTonse maam, addressed the yuva-s and discussed\nbriefly his plans for this Chaturmasa and urged the\nyuva-s to provide their inputs and to participate\nwholeheartedly.\nPadaprakshalana to Phalamantrakshata:\nAn information packed session by Dr. Chaitanya\nGulvady maam, the Dharmapracharaka of Shri\nChitrapur Math kept the youngsters alert and\nenthusiastic through an entirely interactive session.\nVimarsha:\nA Vimarsha session was conducted by senior yuvati\nand upasanchalika, Ankita Karnad pachi who\nensured that all the shibirarthi-s took turns in\ncontributing their understanding of the beautiful\nverse given to them. The verse was aptly chosen\nkeeping in mind the young group that was\nparticipating in the Vimarsha.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202328\nImportance of seva:\nThe word 'seva' is often misinterpreted and it often\ntakes a true devotee to explain its importance, and\nit was Maithili Padukone pachi who presented a crisp\nand interactive session on the opportunities and\nimportance of seva to the shibirarthi-s. Having\nattended many Kara Seva Shibir-s as a shibirarthi\nas well as a sanchalika herself, she caught the pulse\nof the audience by sharing what one can expect out\nof attending shibir-s and being in seva. Through her\nown experiences and wit, she highlighted that seva\ndoes lead to the transformation of the sadhaka or\nyuva into very capable mature individuals under the\ngrace of our Guru's Anugraha.\nClimate Change and Forests:\nThe world today is progressing at breakneck speed\nand one of the worst affected in this process are\nthe forests and greenery that play a key role in\nhelping the earth breathe. The growth and\ndevelopment of each city sadly leads to the\ndepletion of forests and wildlife that help maintain\nthe balance of nature. Praveen Basrur maam,\nknown for his role and contribution in the Forest\nDepartment of Karnataka, made a presentation that\nspoke about the growing concerns over the loss of\ntree cover and increasing temperatures in the\nmetropolitan cities of India.\nShri Devi Anushthana:\nAlthough Kara Seva largely involves field work, visits\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202329\nand informative presentations, important forms of\nsadhana are also taught to the yuva-s during the\nshibir. This session was meticulously conducted by\nSangita Pawar pachi. She provided important\ninformation on how the Shri Devi Anushthana\nserves as a powerful form of sadhana to propitiate\nthe Devi and also shared details on how to perform\nit correctly.\nSankshipta Sandhyavandanam:\nThis session was conducted by Dr Chaitanya\nGulvady maam for the boys. He emphasised the\nimportance of doing Sandhyavandanam daily and\npresented a method which would help to complete\nthe Sandhyavandanam in just 7 minutes.\nShri Guru Pujana and Shri Paduka Pujana:\nOn Thursday, 11th May, the shibirarthi-s performed\nShri Guru Pujana in the Divine Presence of H.H.\nSwamiji. Each of them was provided with a paleru\nfor Shri Paduka Pujana. Some of them eagerly took\nturns to offer bhajana seva during Shri Paduka\nPujana and Tirtha vitarana.\nSrivali High School Visit:\nA number of institutional and site visits kept the\nshibirarthi-s busy.

It was no surprise that\nthe youngsters found the carpentry and pond-\ncleaning sessions to be the most exciting and\nPranayama-Ninada sessions to be utmost essential.\nWith a few good laughs and an icecream in hand,\nthe sanchalika-s enjoyed their discussion with H.H.\nSwamiji. His Holiness ensured that each of the\nsanchalika-s took turns to speak and those who\nwere shy or hesitant were not missed out. The\nsecond interaction took place in the peaceful setting\nof Panchavati with the soothing sounds of birds\nchirping in the evening sun. Some even spotted a\nfamily of peacocks. H.H. Swamiji and everyone else\nwas seated in front of the Dhyana Mandira.\nDelicious snacks were served along with kokum\nsharbat and icecream.

Swamiji also stressed upon the importance of\ndoing Japa Pranayama-Ninada and physical exercise\ndaily. This cherished interaction took place on\nFriday 12th of May.

This\nsession took place at Panchavati. Omkar is a master\njuggler who also effortlessly balances himself on the\n'slack line'- a flat rope that is tied across two trees-\nwhile juggling as well! The youngsters were\nawestruck and were eager to try their hand at\njuggling, flow chakra and walking the tight rope.\nOmkar emphasised on how these skills are almost\nmeditative, require balance, whole body coordination\nand focus. He pointed out how the principles of\nthese skills can be applied to our daily lives. This\nsession took place a second time at Panchavati,\nwhere each shibirarthi attempted rope walking at\nleast once and tried their hand at juggling and flow\nchakra again. However, this time it was even more\nspecial and memorable as H.H. Swamiji drove up\nto Panchavati to grace the session! The yuva-s\ndemonstrated to H.H. Swamiji what they had learnt.\nA session with Shri Sanjay Shetty:\nVery rarely do we come across a person who has\ntrained defence personnel in Germany, Austria,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202334\nHongkong, The UK's MI5, and also holds the\ndistinction of being the only non-Jewish trainer to\nthe Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service.

He works with the\nIndian Army and trains the Prime Minister's body\nguard and military intelligence. With this jaw-\ndropping introduction it was no surprise that the\nshibirarthis watched Sanjay maam's display of self-\ndefence tactics with rapt attention. The youngsters\nthrew many 'what if' questions at him and he had\nall the answers on how to tackle and bring down\nan attacker. How to disarm an attacker who could\nbe wielding a knife, a gun or a rod was\ndemonstrated and techniques to safeguard oneself\nin case of assault too. A couple of yuva-s volunteered\nfor the demonstration with a degree of nervousness\nmuch to the amusement of others. It was an\nextremely rewarding and eye-opening session with\ninnumerable insights.\nAs the days progressed, there was an overwhelming\nemotion building up as the end of the first Kara\nSeva Shibir of 2023 was coming to an end. To mark\nthe finale of this shibir, the shibirarthi-s planned\na memorable cultural program and a valedictory\nfunction.  The yuva-s were split into groups\naccording to their skill set - music, dance and\ndrama. Upasanchalaka-s Shivani Kallianpur and\nAtul Prasad were instrumental in putting together\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam July 202335\na musical performance with a medley of old and\nnew songs rendered by a group of shibirarthi-s.

Swamiji's Ashirvachana, participants came up\nto receive their Pramana Patra (certificate of\nparticipation), Phalamantrakshata, and blessings\nfrom H.H.

Shrimat Sadyojat Shankarashram\nSwamiji, has sent us back to our lives with a sense\nof responsibility, discipline and faith.

So, she sent Pappa Drake\nto fetch the softest grass, which she weaved into the nest. She\nthen heaved a sigh of relief, \"Now our nest is p erfect for our\nH. H.

She returned with a determined look, \"Suchu\nsuggested we add more grass to our nest.\" Pappa protested but\nspent the rest of the day looking for more grass. Days passed,\nAmma Duck continued moving heaven and earth to ensure that\nshe was doing everything right. She had consulted every duck in\nthe forest and became flustered with every passing day.\nOne evening, when there was still no sign of her ducklings, she\ngloomily watched the Sun as it set on another day. \"What are we\nmissing?\" she asked Pappa Drake. \"The present moment,\" he\nreplied. Amma Duck looked at him, puzzled. \"We have been so\nbusy getting everything right that we have completely missed\nliving in the present moment. Why don't we focus on hatching\nour eggs instead of worrying about when they will hatch? Let us\njust sit and watch this beautiful sunset. The ducklings will hatch\nwhen they are meant to hatch,\" reassured Pappa Drake.\nHe was so right! For the next few days, Amma Duck sat\npeacefully on her nest all day and all night while Pappa Drake\nensured she was safe and well-fed. They watched many glorious\nsunsets together .

GOPAL S. HATTIANGADI\n    The Sage of Chitrapur, Swami Anandashram, is\nthe most understanding person I have ever known.\nIn his presence, I felt secure and at ease. I shall not\nsee the like of him in my lifetime.\n    From the vast and unforgettable saga of his life,\nI intend to touch on two events: my first and last\nmeetings with him.\nMy first meeting :\n    January  21,  1927  is  a  date  enshrined  in  my\nheart. A week prior to that, my father announced:\n\"We are shifting to the servants quarters. For the\nnext few days, our residence (at Clive Road, New\nDelhi)  will  be  set  apart  for  a  Special  Guest.\"\nAnticipating my inquiry, he added briefly, \"God is\ncoming. God in human form.\"\n    My fifth birthday had been celebrated only the\nprevious month. I was far too young to know who or\nwhat \"God is; and far too timid to ask whether one\nshould  love  or  fear  God\".  Father's  additional\nadmonitions petrified me: God is not to be disturbed.\nNo prying into God's room. No rambling on your\ntricycle.\" Then came the soothing balm: God is kind.\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

Do not be afraid.deg With the suggestion\nof a smile, he patted me gently on the back.\n   Father had taken leave of absence to wait on the\nSpecial Guest: a very unique phenomenon, for I had\nnever seen him stay away from work even when he\nwas quite unwell.\n   At an opportune moment, curiosity got the better\nof me. Slowly and silently, I went on my tricycle to\nthe forbidden area, and peeped into each one of the\nrooms. Finally, I saw \"God in human form.\" He was\nThe One to whom I prayed daily (and do so even\nnow): \"Swami, Dayya, Pampa\"!\n   Swami, Dayya, Pampa was alone, seated on a\nmattress, erect but but relaxed, reading a book.\nPresently, he kept the book aside, shut his eyes,\nand seemed to ponder over something. After a short\ntime, as he was about to pick up the book, he\nlooked in the direction of the door and saw me. With\na benign smile, he beckoned me to enter. I was at\nthe crossroads Should I beat a hasty retreat and\ndisplease ''Swami, Dayya,' or disobey father's\nmandate and invite a fully deserved caning?\n   As though sensing my dilemma, the Swami arose,\nwalked with measured footsteps towards the door,\nheld my hand, led me to the mattress, and asked\nme to sit down beside him. He spoke softly and\ntenderly, but, at this distance of time, I cannot recall\na single word of what he said. He gave me an apple\nto eat and I vividly remember requesting him to\nshare it with me.\n   Panic-stricken that father might enter the room\nat any moment, I was anxious to run away; but not\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        7                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nbefore noticing that the Swami, though always\nsmiling, had a sad faraway look. After I had prostrated\nand sought permission to leave (I was well-mannered\nin those days), the Swami made me sit on his lap\nand embraced me. The love he emanated, kindled in\nme an everlasting bond of devotion.\n   During the next forty years, I had the privilege\nof meeting this Man of God on numerous occasions\nat various venues, of sitting at his feet in silence,\nand, above all, of trying to learn from him the right\nway of life.\nMy last meeting :\n   What eventually turned out to be my last meeting\nwith Swami Anandashram before he left his body\nwas at Bangalore on August 21, 1966. He must have\nbeen ailing and weak that day because, unlike his\ncustomary habit of sitting on an armchair he was\nreclining on his bed. I stood close by, speechless\nand paralysed with fear that he might say softly at\nany moment: \"My work is done, I am withdrawing.\"\n   We looked at each other in silence for a prolonged\nperiod. Ultimately, when I bowed down on bended\nknees, rested my head near his feet, and whispered\nif I had his permission to return to Bombay, he\ninquired by gestures at what time the airplane was\nscheduled to depart. Glancing at his pocket-watch\nkept beside his pillow, he signalled me to sit down.\nI did so, shut my eyes, and did not utter a word. In\nthose moments of uneasy quiet, several thoughts\npassed through my mind; primarily, that I should\nhave learnt much more from this adored Teacher.\n   After January 1927, I did not meet Swami\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        8                    May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nAnandashram for almost ten years; he rarely moved\noutside the Kanaras, whereas I kept shutting between\nNew Delhi and Simla to settle down fmally in\nBombay. Thus, the second opportunity which I had\nof seeing him was at Shirali in summer of 1936; I\nhad passed the Matriculation examination of the\nUniversity of Bombay with a measure of success,\nand father suggested that we both went to offer our\nobeisance and seek blessings before I entered the\ncollege portals. With father's reticence in speech\nand value of time, we were both in and out of Swami's\nroom within seconds (having travelled three days,\nfrom Bombay to Shirali).\n   I went again with father in 1940, this time to\nSatara where Swami Anandashram had retreated for\nobserving Chaturmasya. Later, I joined Swami's\nretinue and accompanied him on visits to Sajjangadh,\nPaithan and Audumbar. Two years earlier, in 1938,\nhe had asked me to go with him to Alandi, Chinchwad\nand Dehu. The few words of spiritual wisdom which\nthe Swami imparted to me during the journeys to\nthese holy places far outweighed the \"knowledge\" I\nhad gained in the preceding decade, reading scores\nof books written by seeming scholars.\n   The next visit to Shirali was with my wife and son\nin the summer of 1947, to seek Swami's blessings\nprior to my departure to the U.S.A. for post-doctoral\nstudies. He was away at that time; but He gave us\na very pleasant surprise by halting at Kumta and\ngranting us an audience.\n   I was unable to meet Swami Anandashram as\nfrequently and for as long as I desired during the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        9                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nnext decade. I was selected by a multinational\ncompany overseas for a senior managerial position,\nand I went almost from the pier to a factory on my\nreturn to India.\n   My father, who \"rendered twenty-five years of\nservice to the Math, always looking ahead and\nworking silently with steadfast faith in the Guru\",\npassed away in 1957. Six years later, Shripad L\nHemmady, \"the last of a generation that is now but\na memory\", also joined the great majority. The loss\nin quick succession of two able men of honesty and\nintegrity grieved even the serene renunciant, Swami\nAnandashram.\n   The end of 1955 marked the beginning of\ndissensions in the establishment. Swami\nAnandashram summoned me twice to indicate that\nI should take an active interest in Math\nadministration. In 1962, my entreaty was to wait\nand see, and to avoid precipitancy; in 1963, weighing\nthe gravity of the situation, I submitted to his superior\njudgment and prayed: \"I am overwhelmed with the\nfaith and trust which you repose in me. I am totally\ninexperienced, and seek no power except that of\nyour grace.\" The Swami simply smiled and raised\nhis palm in blessing. This timeless scene reminded\nme of a rishi of an ancient aeon. I was formally\ninducted into a secretarial position in December\n1963, but functioned in a variety of roles, from peon\nupwards. Much of what I did, wise or otherwise, is\nsufficiently well-known to be repeated. Except\nperhaps two little-known facts: Swami Anandashram\ndesired that I should be the President of the\nMahasabha held in December 1965, and again asked\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       10                  May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nme to take over as President of the Standing\nCommittee after the demise of A.V. Shankar Rau in\nJanuary 1966. When I beseeched him on both\noccasions to excuse me, he graciously nodded assent:\nand I was happy that he had read my mind correctly.\n     The stream of thoughts then flowed gently along\n     its sacred course. In that placid ambience, many\n     gems of Swami Anandashram's spiritual advice\n     touched the right chords of my heart. I recalled\n     them to memory in later years, composed some\n     in the form of blank verse, and am reproducing\n     a few below in remembrance of this \"God in\n     human form.\"\n1)   What is really vital is faith in God: The unknown\n     invisible Supreme Spirit. God is without a\n     beginning or an end; God is The First Cause of\n     everything.\n2)   God is one: absolute and inscrutable; God is\n     indeed without a name or form. God is very\n     near and also far beyond; God is inside and\n     outside us as well.\n3)   Time cannot erase the concept of God; Which\n     is neither mythical nor modern. God is the\n     Seer revered by all seers; Prayer leads us to\n     that Supreme Seer.\n4)   God is Light because neither is seen; Only\n     their manifestations are beheld. God's light\n     outshines a million suns; It is the glow of the\n     Supreme Spirit.\n5)   Spiritual Wisdom is a godly treasure; It is\n     bestowed only on worthy people. Imparting it to\n     one who is unknowing; Is like presenting a gem\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       11                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nto a monkey.\n6)    Light and Wisdom direct one to Truth, Of which\n     there are two diverse forms. One is based on\n     datum of experiments; The second on devotional\n     experiences.\n7)    Much truth is spoken, more is hidden; It needs\n     no  proem,  it  reveals  itself.  When  praying  to\n     God, speak the truth, As that is the most sacred\n     of duties.\n8)    Recompose  the  mind  for  concentration;\n     Orchestrate   the   heart   for   meditation;\n     Harmonise  the  soul  for  contemplation;\n     Any hour of the day is the Hour of the God.\n   (Courtesy : Reproduced from the book ANANDI-ANANDA)\n\n  YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE -  A CORRECTION\n\n    On page 11 of April 2024 issue of Sunbeam, the\nabove photo was featured, but, the surname was\nwrongly given as Chandavarkar by oversight.\n    The correct name is Shri Gurunandan Padukone.\nThe error is regretted.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                               May  202412","type":"Document"}

So the Mathadhipati himself\ngoes to meet the laity and give them blessings and\na few words of advice.  We have been wanting to\ncome here on such a tour for a long time now, but\ncould do so only now, with our responsibilities at\nthe Math having lightened, enabling Us to step out.\nIt  has  also  been  part  of  the  tradition  to  give  an\nAshirvachan at the conclusion of such a visit. We\nremember  accompanying  His  Holiness  (Swami\nAnandashram) when He came here in 1965 and we\nsat here on this stage with Him, listening to His\nHoliness's Ashirvachan. Today, ten years later, we\nare  again  seated on  this  stage  before you  in  the\nsame reverential spirit.\n    Shankaracharya has told us that spiritual progress\nis possible for man only if God's Grace is there. His\nattaining human birth itself is due to God's Grace\nand the result of the good deeds of many past births\nperformed  by  him.  If  he  would  only  stop  to\ncontemplate,  he  would  realise  that  he  has  been\ngiven this human body to realise his divine heritage\nand not to fritter away his time like cats and dogs\nin pursuit of transient pleasures. He must liberate\nhimself from the cycle of birth and death. What is\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                               May  202413\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe type of spiritual practice that he should undergo\nto achieve this liberation? For those who would want\nto progress on the spiritual path, the guidance of\nGuru is essential. The Guru's main purpose is to\nsave the devotee, to steer him on to the right path\nsuited to each disciple according to his abilities and\ntemperament. The Guru only wants the disciple's\ngood.\n   Every man in the world seeks happiness. This is\na universal fact. As soon as intelligence dawns in\nhim as a child, he starts looking for happiness.\nHowever, leaving aside the real source of happiness\nwithin him, man looks for his happiness outside in\nthe delusion that his joy depends on attainments of\nexternal objects of his desire.     Happiness is of two\nkinds, one is the shadow of happiness which is\nillusory and the other is the real and abiding\nhappiness that lies witin us.           That is why, our\nancients have told us that we can achieve lasting\nhappiness only if we attain Self. But, because of his\nhuman nature, man does not go within himself. All\nhis senses and all his faculties are directed outside\non external objects. He has to realise that there is\none God who is all-pervading, who is seated not only\nin the hearts of others but within him also. God is\nomniscient and omnipresent in all His creation. He\nis also known as Nirguna, or One who has no Gunas.\nHow can you meditate on such a Supreme Being\nwho is formless? What or Who is that Power? Before\nall creation took place, there was only God, the\nSupreme Brahman and nothing else and there was\nno way by which He could enjoy Himself. So, He\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       14                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ndecided for the sake of Leela or divine sport to\nproject from Himself all this creation for the sake of\nHis mays. He first projected forth His Shakti Swarupa,\nwhom we call as Adi Shakti, Brahma Shakti.. As\nsoon as She was projected, She knew why She was\nthere, that She had to carry out the wishes of\nBrahman and bring forth creation. So, She, in turn,\ncreated the three forces of Satva, Rajas and Tamas\nas embodied in Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and\nentrusted them with the functions aligned to these\nthree states, namely, creation, preservation and\ndestruction. These three states today condition and\ngovern all existence and even within man himself,\nthe three forces are at work all the time, whether he\nis aware of it or not.\n   This is the City of Kali who is portrayed as\nstanding with a string of human skulls round Her\nneck and Her tongue protruding out. Why is She\nportrayed thus? It is said that because man is mortal,\nwhen his \"Kaal (time) comes, he has to go, to shed\nhis mortal frame, the body which has separated him\nfrom the Supreme Being. Kali embodies that Kaala\nShakti. She wears the garland of skulls to remind\nus and to make us realise that we are not the mortal\nbodies we have assumed but that we have emanated\nfrom Adi Shakti. As We said before, every man wants\nhappiness but he doesn't attain it. The Upanishads\ntell us that we should seek out the real source of\nhappiness that was ours before we assumed the\nhuman form which has brought us all the ills of\nhuman existence. For that, we have to know what is\nMoksha or liberation. It means attaining the Self by\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       15                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nrealising that we are not the body but the real Self\nseated in all beings and creatures. Once you have\nattained Truth, you will have attained the real object\nof your life and be free from the cycle of birth and\ndeath.\n    There are many paths to Him, the paths of Jndna\nYoga, Bhakti Yoga, Rita Yoga and Karma. Yoga. We\nhave to first understand what is Dharma. It is the\ndivine law of creation. Once you are born in the\nworld, your human nature compels you to perform\naction. But, if you do your duty according to the\nDharma, then its results do not attach themselves\nto you. Dharma then means doing one's duty. The\nconcept of Dharma may change with the times but\nits basic tenets remain the same. In the olden times,\nit was believed that Dharma meant getting up early\nin the morning, observing Sandhyavandana, wearing\na tuft, etc. The Dharma of 100 years ago no longer\nprevails today. If the old practices have ceased to be,\nit does not mean that we have abandoned Dharma.\nToday, it is not observances because the pattern of\nlife has changed so vastly. Even Vaidiks find it difficult\nto pursue the prescribed discipline laid down for\nthem. Even so, there is the basic Dharma laid down\nfor all householders who need not give up all the\ngood practices that have come down from olden days.\nEach one has to pursue his duty. He should perform\nhis duty according to his limitations, within his own\nsphere with all his heart. Dharma teaches us to be\nkind and considerate to all around us, not to harm\nother living creatures, to look on other people as our\nown brothers and sisters, because we are all from\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        16                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe same Mother and therefore to seek only good of\nothers. There are many paths that lead to the\nSupreme Being. Each one has to follow the path for\nwhich he is mentally equipped. He must realise that\nhis happiness does not lie in worldly pursuits. All\nSadhakas have to realise that the God they seek is\nwithin them and concentrate their efforts on attaining\nHim. We now conclude our brief Ashirvachan and\npray to Lord Bhavanishankar to bless you all with\nthe fulfilment of your desires.","type":"Document"}

Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji\n\n            GREATNESS OF ADI SHANKARA\n    Of the Vibhuti Purushas born in Bharata, Shri\nShankara Bhagavatpada is the foremost. It is known by all\nthat he was an incarnation of Lord Shiva. He achieved the\ngoal of his avatdra not by showing miracles, but with\nscholarship, brilliant debating and wonderful teaching. In\na short life span one can study a lot and become a\nscholar, or can travel throughout the country or can write\na number of books. Shankaracharya did all these and a lot\nmore.\nExtensive Writing :\n    He wrote extensively from Brahma Sutra Bhashya to\nEka Shloki. In Brahma Sutra, it is said, what was in the\nheart of Veda Vyasa, has been clearly explained. Adi\nShankara's style of writing is unemotional, simple and\nflowery. Such is his greatness that among the\ncommentaries he wrote for great works is one for the 12\nshlokas composed by his disciple Hastamalaka.\n    He wrote such original works as Viveka Choodmani\nand Upadeaa Sahasri. For the common, man, he wrote\nmany stotras in praise of all the gods and goddesses.\nReality is one\n    While establishing Advaita Siddhanta, he declared that\nthe Reality is only one and the rest is unreal. That\neternal truth is called Brahman. If everyone is not\nexperiencing this Brahman, it is because of the\naccumulated Karma. Once all the karma is cleansed, the\nindividual realises Brahman.\n    Some raised the objection, \"Where is the scope for\nVarnashrama Dharma in Advaita Siddhanta. By your\nAdvaita   Siddhanta you have flouted Varnashrqama\nDharma.\" Nowhere has Adi Shankara slighted\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         25                    May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nVarnashrama.\nThe Need for Karma\n   For those who have not yet reached the highest\nstate of enlightenment, Varnashrama Dharma is very\nessential. It is clearly stated that performing Karma\nis a must for all. When the Lord, who is the\nultimate cause of everything is engaged in activity,\nwhat about others.\n   Sri Shankara's compassion knew no bounds. Even\nto the Kapalika who asked for his head, he not only\nagreed to sacrifice himself, but also told him to come\nwhen the disciples were not there, sothat he could\nhave his head easily.\nFor National Integration\n   A great service Adi Shankara did for the country\nis to think of national integration. A Namnboodri of\nKerala was made the priest of Badrinath. One from\nMaharashtra was sent as the priest to\nRameshwaram. The priests at the Pashupatinath\ntemple in Nepal are from Karnataka.\nSureshwaracharya of North India was made the\npontiff of the Sringeri Math in the South.\nTotakacharya of the South was put in charge at\nJyotirmath in the North. By doing all this, Shankara\ntaught us that all Indians should feel that we are\none.\nPreservation of Dharma\n   The sacred duty of the Maths he established is to\nprotect, preserve and spread Sanatana Dharma. The\nSringeri Math is doing its best to discharge its duty\nby having various activities such as establishing\nPathshalas, supporting Veda Pundits, encouraging\nstudents of Veda, conducting the Veda Sabha and so\non.'\n                                       (Courtsery : Tattvaloka)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       26                   May 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

On the menu\n                                  were Ajju's special pav bhaji and\n                                  gulab jamun.

You have beaten\nthem before and have practised all day. I'm sure you will do well,\"\nPappa tried to reassure him, but that made Purav even more tense.\n\"I think you should take a break now, buddy. You don't want to\nburn yourself out before the match,\" suggested Pappa. But Purav\nwould not hear any of it.\nAfter some cajoling, Purav finally opened up to Pappa. A few\nmatches ago, Purav had missed a shot that had cost his team the\ntournament. He had not scored a single basket ever since. A\nstrange fear would grip him every time he had to shoot. He would\nthen pass the ball to avoid shooting. Purav had been practising\nharder to retain his position in the team. While he had become\nbetter at shooting, he had still not overcome his fear.\n\"Purav, you are good at this and have been practising diligently. You\nmust stop worrying about the outcome of your game and start\nenjoying it like you used to,\" Pappa advised. \"That is easier said\nthan done,\" complained Purav.\n\"Things don't always turn out as we want them to, my child. We\nmust learn from our mistakes and move on. Just surrender to the\nAlmighty and play your game,\" said Pappa.\n\"Surrender?! That is for the weak and helpless!\" Purav scoffed.\n\"Is 'weak' an adjective you would associate with Hanuman? Was\nanything impossible for him? Yet, He is the epitome of surrender\nand devotion.

Although like Mount Kailas His head stood\nin majesty far above the rolling clouds floating by\nand raging storms and turmoil below, He had His\nfeet on the ground and looked just like any mortal,\neven as Shri Krishna appeared to Arjuna before He\nrevealed Himself in His universal, cosmic form. Shri\nAnandashram. Swamiji would come down to our\nlevel to keep us from any inhibition and awe about\nHis spiritual height. He cut jokes, played on words,\nregaled with amusing, humorous anecdotes and\nmade witty remarks as occasions demanded. Despite\nwinds of change and the trends for reforms. He still\nprized the traditional ways          (mebOeoe3e) and would\nreligiously stick to it. His uniform courtesy and\nutmost consideration was never failing: and this with\ncomplete self-effacement and utter humility. The\nmagnitude of His greatness would be a matter of\nspeculation to most, but only elevated souls could\nknow it just as an experienced goldsmith only can\ndiscern real gold from the spurious gilted one.\n   In the following paras, a few instances of what\nhas been stated above are recounted for the benefit\nof the curious and the inquisitive, to know the human\naspect of Mahapurush.\n   His humour was like peppermint without the\npepper, spicy, sometimes subtle. Sometimes obvious\nwithout barbs but always with salve. Swamiji was\ninvited to lay the foundation stone for Anandashram\nColony at Bangalore. He arrived at the place and\nwas received ceremoniously and guided to a wooden\nboard to step on for     HeeoHetpee. Some took photographs.\nThat was several decades ago. Years later when\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       16                January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------\nSwamiji was in Bangalore and invited to some\ndevotees's place for      HeeoHetpee, He noticed a photograph\ntaken on the occasion mentioned above, and most\ncasually remarked. \"This photo must have been taken\non a new moon day\". The attending purohit for\nrefreshing the memory of Swamiji said, \"Was it not\na Vijayadashami Day that the foundation stone was\nlaid when this photo must have been taken?\" Swamiji\nreplied \"To us it appeared to be a new moon day\",\nwith a flicker of smile. We set ourselves thinking,\nsince Swamiji's razor-sharp memory could not make\nsuch an obvious mistake. There was a catch\nsomewhere in His words. After some hard thinking,\nthe answer to the problem dawned on us. As Swamiji\nstood there on the board for            HeeoOe#eeueve, behind Him\nstood Surya Bhatiji and Chandra Bhatiji. We all\nknow that the sun and the moon rise together only\non a new moon day. After a little while when Swamiji\nwas told that we could understand the significance\nof the remarks, He just gave His graceful bewitching\nsmile.\n    On this occasion of laying the foundation stone\nwhilst blessing the scheme commending the\ncooperative effort for housing, He said\n     'HegAUUs JeAeueebleg JeAesCeeJeAF& Deeuen JeAle&vee 'oesve efoJeme jeyyegveg SJeA pesJeCe\npesJeveg\" cnCeleeues.

Smilingly\nSwamiji said    'Dejs, lebt keAefHe HeeE3e IesJegveg Dee3eueecejs\" Shri Talmaki\ngave a wan smile inwardly apprehending Swamiji's\ndisapproval of the youngsters. Within minutes his\nsunken spirits buoyed up. Swamiji asked him if\nTalmakis were not originally Mankikars. The light\nfell on the joke and he burst out. On one of His\nvisits to Bangalore, Swamiji was requested to grace\nwith His presence at staging of a Konkani drama.\nThe theme was social, of youngster's change in\nattitude after marriage. The talented Saraswat couple\n(Padukone) were in the roles of the afflicted parents.\nThere were hot words between the parents, for and\nagainst the son. Swamiji in His benediction remarked\nthat He had heard that husband and wife quarrel\nwithin the cloister of their own home, but He\nwitnessed that day a quarrel between husband and\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         18                  January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------\nwife in the open and in public! A friend of mine,\nwho was very hard of hearing and who usually\nguessed words by the contours and the movements\nof the lips of the speakers, had come to pay respect\nto Swamiji. It was evening. Whilst conversing the\nlights suddenly went off. Swamiji slightly raising His\nvoice asked \"The lights of course are gone, but, can\nyou hear me? Shall we continue to talk?\" What an\nexample of consideration for others.\n   A gentleman who sojourned at the Math for 3 or\n4 days was asked on the first day by his friend if he\nhad finished his breakfast. The gentleman in reply\nsaid he had finished what can be an apology for a\nbreakfast. Asked for the reason he said he has been\naccustomed to taking Bournvita and the Math tea\ncannot touch the fringe of that beverage. Swamiji\nwho had eyes and ears about in the Math came to\nknow this and immediately sent a man to get\nBournvita from Bhatkal. To the utter discomfiture\nand dismay of the gentleman he got his favourite\ndrink for the noon tea. Our Swamiji had few peers\nin matters of simplicity, frugality and punctiliousness.\nWhen it was pointed out that His katcha had frayed\nand new ones may be got. He questioned, \" Why, is\nit because the Math is paying for it? With a little\nmending it can go easily for another six months.\" In\nthe course of a casual talk about the future, He said\nHe did not approve of a Samadhi involving\nconsiderable expenses and restrictions. A tulsi\nvrindavan for Him in the country yard could be\ntended even by uninitiated youngsters and even\nladies. If one carefully observed Swamiji at the\nceremonial evening puja one never failed to notice\nhow very carefully He culled out tender tulsi and\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19                January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------\nbael for affectionate tendering to the Deity\naccompanied by abounding devotion and love. At\nsome discourses which He gave some books were\nordered. A copy each was given to a few who wanted\nit and one was retained by Swamiji. The next day\nwhen, as usual, the Pravachan commenced, and the\nbooks were opened it was found the Swamiji's was\nthe only copy that had a wrapper whilst the others'\nwere bare. Phadke Shastri, who was one of them\nwho took a copy, apologized for this seeming lapse.\n   For all His catholicity, Swamiji still held fast to\ntradition and never failed to observe the Math         mebOeoe3e.\nEven as a stripling when He was initiated as Shishya\nSwami He never turned His head in the direction of\nthe voice when His niece, a toddler (daughter of His\nerstwhile sister whom he fondled so lovingly) shouted\nout \"Mama, Mama\" to Him when she came to the\nMath. What an example of detachment and\nrenunciation. Once on His Delhi visit a Saraswat\nlady hosteler wrote to Him personally seeking an\ninterview for some advice. The chief of the host\ncommittee could not say who the lady could be.\nHowever, after enquiries, the writer was located and\na word sent for the interview on a particular day and\ntime. When conveying this to the chief He told him\nhe would have to be present at the time of interview.\nThe chief got perplexed and was in a quandary. He\ncould not say no to Swamiji and yet he felt his\npresence would deter the lady from speaking out\nher mind. Swamiji noticed the uneasiness on the\nface of the chief. On the interview day in the morning\nHe told the chief he need not be present and that\nGanesh Bhatji would take his place : a great relief\nto the chief whose face was wreathed in smile. How\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20                January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------\nvery correct was our Swamiji in following the\ntraditions which to so many of our modern women\nfolks may seem strange and unwarranted. Even when\nladies took Japa from Swamiji the husband had to\nbe present, or some Bhatji would be present. The\ntradition was so rigidly followed that when P.P.\nPandurangashram Swamiji's mother was terminally\nill and wanted to have Swamiji's blessings for her\nliberation, Swamiji consented. With a cloth sheet\nheld between the mother and Him, Swamiji comforted\nthe ailing soul and gave peace and liberation. Perhaps\nas a head of the Math this has to be observed in\ncontrast to the general unrestricted freedom in case\nof lay babas, saints and maharajs.\n   Swamiji was steeped in all the cardinal virtues.\nHe was the embodiment of          meeOeeve (r)elega3eandMeceeefo<eidkeA:\nOnce He was served with tea in which salt was put\nby mistake instead of sugar, the two containers being\nnext to each other. After Swamiji had finished, the\npurohit partook of the leftover tea and to his great\nhorror he realized the error. None ever tastes the\noffering to Swamiji as Shabri did her offering to Shri\nRama. To the repentant person seeking pardon\nSwamiji said \"Oh, do not worry. We took it only as\na change from the usual\" with a sense of amusement.\n   Spiritual eminence of Swamiji can be gauged\nonly by those who are also elevated. Sri Benegal\nSanjiv Rao's rich tributes to Swamiji is common\nknowledge. When he had gone to enquire of Swamiji's\nhealth, Swamiji skillfully changed the subject and\ntalked about Sri Sanjiv Rao himself. Graceful self-\neffacement.\n   It was a memorable meeting when our Swamiji\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       21                January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------\nmet Maharshi Ramana at Ramanashram. The two\nsat still for quite some time facing each other in\nsilent communion. All round there was pin-drop\nsilence in the hall. As Swamiji started to leave,\nMaharshi reached Him to the door. Swamiji had\ncome to the hall a little earlier and taken His seat\non a chair close to Maharshi's couch. When Maharshi\nstepped in He waved with His hands asking all to be\nseated and not to stand up to avoid embarrassment\nto our Swamiji. A foreign devotee had aksed to be\nshown a    efmLeleOe%e. and Maharshi had assured him He\nwould in a few days. When the foreigner reminded\nHim about his request Maharshi asked him if he\nhad not seen Him come in saffron vestment and\nseated on a chair in front of Him, obviously referring\nto our Swamiji.\n   A Maharashtrian friend surprised at our having\na Dharma Guru, wanted to be introduced to Him.\nHe himself was a great sadhak and ritualist. The\ninterview was arranged. On the appointed day the\nsadhak arrived in full regalia with caste mark etc.\nHe was ushered into the room for Swamiji's audience.\nHe approached Swamiji, made \"Sashtang namaskar\"\nand sat on the floor in Padmasan. Thus he sat for\nsome time, and then asked          'DeesUKe Heiefuevee\" Swamiji\nsaid 'nes3e\" The sadhak again made flat obeisance and\nwithdrew. Whilst leaving, he remarked to my friend\nthat our community, as he knew, more than deserved\nsuch high-souled Personage as Guru.\n   To this Mahapurush, such an Illumined Soul, I\nbow down in reverence again and again with a prayer\n\"Teach me to do Thy will.\"\n     (First published in Sunbeam, September, 1983)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       22                January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

But, even\nthough I would come here often, I could not stay here\nlong enough.

May all\nenjoy this experience and, to this end, dedicate their\nlives at the feet of Ram, at the feet of Papa and at the\nfeet of Mataji. Then, their coming into the world will\nhave been worthwhile.\n    I would like to take this opportunity to quote four\nor five kirtans about Ram, which have inspired me.\n                      meble (r)ejCe jpe ueeieleeb menpe~\n                    JeemeveW(r)es yeerpe peUesve pee3e~~1~~\n                      ceie jece veeces GHepes DeeJe[er~\n                    megKe Ie[es Ie[er Jee{t ueeies ~~2~~\n                     JebAther Oesce oeis ve3eveer veerj ueesis~\n                      Eo3eer OeieiW veece aHe ~~3~~\n                     legJeAe cnCes meeOeve megueYe ieesceiW~\n                     Heefj GHeefleas HetJe& HegC3eW~~4~~\n    Ramnam is the veritable Form of Truth. But all are\nnot willing to take the Name. When we were in Kashi,\nthere lived a Swamiji who used to exhort all 'Chant\nRamnam, chant Ramnam'. Hearing his exhortation,\none disciple asked\" \"Why, is anyone dead?\" Many\npeople seem to be of the view that Ramnam is chanted\nonly for the dead, for the body as it were. But, this is\nnot true. Ram.nam is for the mind, for the soul, for\nthe intellect and he who takes the Name not only\ncleanses his body and mind but also makes himself\nfit for realisation. The Name inspires devotion, adoration\nand worship. The Name enables you to forget whatever\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam            24                   January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------\nsorrows or worries are afflicting you. Ramnam does\nnot cost you anything. You can take the Name wherever\nyou are, whether you are sitting or working or doing\nanything else you are asked to take the Name like a\n\"tailadhara.\", that is ceaselessly. Do as much Ramnam\njapa as you can. This is what Papa and Mataji taught\nus. That is why it is always important to live with\nsaints, to touch their holy feet. They remind us to go\non singing the Name. Therefore, in this Abhang,\nreference is made to the importance of applying dust\nfrom saint's feet to one's head. So important it is that\nwhen you touch the feet of a saint with all reverence,\nRamnam takes root on its own in your mind and the\ndevotee gets purified. There is an expression here\n\"Vasaneche beej\" meaning the seed of desire. It says\nthat the seed of desire burns itself out at the touch\nof the saint's feet. When the child is born in the world,\nit is not having any sense of possession, it lives and\neven sleeps in a joyful world of its own. But, as the\nchild grows up, it begins to understand that so-and-\nso is its father, so-and-so is its mother and so on until\nit comes to identify every object as 'mine' or 'not mine'.\nThus, the child on growing up becomes a prisoner of\nSamsar. But, saints like Namdev, Tukaram, Jnandev\nhave all taught us that if we keep chanting the Name,\nwe can get over this sense of possession and attain\nsalvation. Saints never delude, they speak from their\nown experience.\n                                                    (Continued)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         25                 January 2025\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

The practices which\narose from contact with the Madhvas also assumed\nthe form of Bhagavata Dharma.

In view of this state\nof affairs, investigations were made in regard to this\nDharma. The Ramakrishna Mission brought out a\npublication entitled The Cultural Heritage of India\nwhich contains a full exposition of all matters relating\nto the Bhagavata Dharma, and it is scarcely necessary\nto repeat it.

Yet others felt\ngratefully blessed for having got an opportunity to offer their\nsalutations at the Lotus Feet of such an exalted saint.\nIrrespective of age and gender, each unblinking gaze was fixed at\nthis Saraswat Sadguru secretly wishing that time would stand\nstill and these Divine moments of incessant bhajana, kirtana and\nAshirvachana would never come to an end.\nAfter Pujya Swamiji's Ashirvachana, devotees from not just\nfrom Ghaziabad, but also places like Noida, Aligarh, Hathras,\nAgra, Mathura, Firozabad, Hapur, Delhi and Rajasthan were\neager to seek Pujya Swamiji's darshana again, and were keenly\ninterested in obtaining information regarding similar\nprogrammes in the near future.

The\ntradition of venerating Dogs\nis popular in Nepal too, as\nthe Kukur Tihar. Tihar is a five\nday long festival during which\nvarious Animals are\nvenerated, including Cows\nand Crows. The second day is\ncelebrated as Kukur Tihar,\nwhen dogs are decorated\nwith , flowers, garland and offered milk, meat or other\nfood.

Some people\nperform this Upasana with their favourite  deity as the object\nand meaning of meditation, in the context of the word\ndevasya in the Mantra. Some look upon the Sun as the goal\nof the Mantra, in view of the use of the word Savitur therein.\nSome others construe Savitur as the Creator of the Universe,\nthat is, the Creator even behind the physical sun, who is\ncalled Ishwara or Saguna Brahma, as the Soul of the Mantra.\nYet others regard the Nirguna Brahma i.e. Existence-\nKnowledge, Bliss (the Absolute) as the substance and the\nsubstratum of the Mantra.\nLet us now turn to the word-by-word meaning of this\nMantra. sskeAej stands for Brahma, both Saguna and Nirguna,\nwhich, though apparently different, are in reality one and\nthe same even as lamp and its light. In the Saguna\nconnotation Yet stands for YetueeskeA i.e. this Earth, mJe for mJeie&ueeskeA i.e.\nthe Heaven, and YegJe: for the Debleefj#e ueeskeA i.e. the world intervening\nbetween the Earth and the Heaven Oeercener means We Meditate\non leled THAT which  is JejsC3eb meaning the Choicest i.e. the\nMost Blissful Yeie&:  'Lustre', (knowledge) osJem3e the Self\nLuminous), meefJeleg: that is Creator,  efOe3ees3eesve: Oe(r)eeso3eeled means 'May\nHE inspire our intellects'.\nGAYATRI MANTRA - ITS SIGNIFICANCE\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 20226\nIn the Nirguna connotation, Yet (from verb Yet to be) stands\nfor 'Existence', YegJe: (to cause to be and cause it to appear in\nthe Vivarta (mere appearance) sense, from YeeJe3eefle i.e. GlHeeo3eefle\n.meaning of the root stands for the 'Knowledge of the\nAbsolute and mJe: (megag efJe'3eles much longed for) for Bliss, leled  means\nAll pervasive, meefJeleg: (OemeefJeleefrom Oemet3eles) gives birth to) the Creator\nmeaning Ultimate Reality behind the phenomenon of the\nUniverse, osJem3e (from the root efoJed to shine) means Knowledge\nAbsolute, JejsC3eb Yeie&: the Choicest Blissful Lustre  (%eeveOekeAeMe) Oeerceefn\nWe meditate Upon, efOe3ees 3eesve: Oe(r)eeso3eeled which is, so to say, Inspirer\nof the Intellectual Modes of the souls. Here in the Vivarta\n(mere appearance) sense, the sixth case in the expression\nmeefJeleg: osJemie JejsC3eb Yeieex: loses its primary sense and carries the\nsecondary meaning, just as in the expression 'Rahu's Head\n(jenesefM&j:) Rahu is Head only and there are no two separate\nentities like Rahu and Head.\nIn short, the Mantra stands for meditation on\nSacchidananda Parabrahma (Existence, Knowledge, Bliss)\nas the Supreme Self and substance of the Cosmos, the God\nInmanent and Transcendent.\nGayatri is the doyen among the Vedic Mantras and its\nefficacy is boundless, We should not tamper with it by\nresorting to logic-chopping. Logic has its own limitations\nin that a thing could often be argued bothways as lawyers\ndo and, therefore, in religious and spiritual matters we have\nto depend on Shraddha (Faith) in 'Revealed Knowledge' i.e.\nthe Vedas. The Vedas are to be understood in the light of\nillumined intelligence. We pray for this illumination when\nwe chant Gayatri. We would urge you to take to Gayatri\nMantra. It will ensure both material welfare (abhyudaya)\nand spiritual weal (nishreyas).\n(Coutrtsey: Kanara Saraswat, Feb, 1957)","type":"Document"}

Hence, our elders prescribed\nthat we should fast every seven days. This advice\nwas not necessarily based on religious grounds but\nin the interest of our constitution as well. You may\nsee this for yourself. On a particular day, if you find\nthat your mind is all in a turmoil, you may take it\nfor certain that it is Sankashti. Similarly, if you find\nyourself beset with passions, it has to be Ekadashi.\nIn order to protect ourselves and at the same time\nliberate ourselves from the tugs and pulls of such\nforces, our elders prescribed fasting. We have\nourselves done some research in this and have\nfound that one cannot dismiss the concept of\nfasting as a foolish outmoded notion. On Ekadashi\ndays, all kinds of ideas arise in one's mind, the\ngerms of passion in everyone of us are enkindled by\nthe food we eat, grow on the food we eat and play\nhavoc with us. It was after considerable research\nthat our elders prescribed fasting for Ekadashi,\nChaturthi etc. Some people blindly observe these\nprescribed fasts without realizing the purpose behind\nthem. The real reason why we have been asked to\nfast on the eve of certain tithis is constitutional, so\nit is absolutely necessary that we should fast on\nsuch days.\nQuestion: Why should one offer Puja on fasting\ndays?\nHis Holiness:  When a man fasts, he becomes\nmentally restless. Hence, our elders prescribed that\non days of fasting, we should worship one particular\ndeity like Ganapathi, or a Devi. Thus, it is laid down\nthat on Sankashti days, we should worship\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 20229\nGanapathi, and observe the day with fast and Puja.\nSimilarly, if it is Angarika. On Shivratri day, we are\nasked to fast and meditate on Lord Shiva. Each\none's constitution is different from that of another.\nTo suit each one's constitution, we are given all\nthese practices. Just as the moon waxes and wanes,\nour body gets subject to all lunar mal-influences. In\norder to prevent that from happening, fasting is the\npanacea. If we do not fast on such tithis, Kama,\nKrodha, Lobha, Moha and Matsara play havoc with\nus. Fasting helps an individual to steel himself\nagainst external influences and develop his inner\nstrength.\nQuestion: Why are certain days of the week\nassociated with particular deities?\nHis Holiness: It is we ourselves who associate each\nday of the week with a particular deity. Thus, Monday\nis associated with Shiva, Tuesday with Devi,\nWednesday with Santoshi Mata, Friday also with\nDevi. These customs are made by us. Meditation on\nGod is not restricted to any particular day. You can\nworship Shiva on a Friday, Devi on Saturday and\nShani on Sunday and so on. But, people don't accept\nthat any day and everyday is good to remember God\nand so they fix days of the week for worship of\nparticular deities. Really speaking, the days of the\nweek are not related to Gods and Goddesses or\nnamed after them but take their names from planets.\nThus, Monday or Somvar stands for Moon, Tuesday\nfor Mars and so on. Once we fix our mind on our\nIshta-Devata, all days become holy to us and fit for\nremembering our Ishta-Devata. But, astrologers fix\ndays of the week after certain planets, and the people\nfix the days of worship. Now, Monday or Somvar is\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202210\nnamed after the moon, It is also a day of worship of\nLord Shiva, whom we depict with the crescent moon\nin His crown.\nQuestion: Is it worthwhile to have Puja etc.?\nHis Holiness: It is both worthwhile and it is not. The\nreason is: one who is backward, who is incapable of\nachieving anything worthwhile, for such a person,\nPuja and ceremonies, have their value in helping\nhim to gain peace of mind. And, our elders have\nprescribed the same for this purpose. Once a man\nhas attained Jnana, once he has realized who he is\nand why (Deelce mee#eelkeAej) he need not perform Puja,\nArchana and the like. For Jnanis, for God-realised\nsouls, Puja and fasting etc. are optional. Speaking\nof saints of our own times, were Ramana Maharshi\nand Swami Nityananda (of Vajreshwari) performing\nPuja? Of course, Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa did\npuja to his Kalika devi but his vision was different.\nHe saw the divine Mother in himself and many a\ntime used to offer worship to his own person, looking\non himself as Kalika.\nAt the same time, there was a valid reason why our\nelders laid down the practice of offering Puja etc. It\nwas to teach us to first see the Eternal in the deity\nwe worshipped and then to see Him in ourselves.\nOne who wants to liberate himself, one who craves\nfor God-realization, one who is already on the path\nto God-realization, may not feel the need for engaging\nhimself in external worship like puja etc. But, for\nmost others, who have yet to be enkindled by such\nan eagerness to realize God, Puja helps to remind\nthem of their true goal in life, it will take them to\nthis goal and get them out of bondage and enable\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202211\nthem to  concentrate on God and God alone.\nBhishma, when his end was approaching while he\nwas lying on a bed of arrows on the battlefield,\ndwelled only on various Lilas of Lord Krishna and on\nHis numerous forms. Likewise if we keep God before\nour mind's eye, we will have achieved the main\npurpose of our Sadhana and will be able to carry on\nall our life's duties and functions with our mind\ntransfixed on the Lord. In such a state, we come to\nregard even the everyday actions we perform as\npassing sights and scenes and will not lose our\nremembrance of God even for a minute. On this\nnote, let us end today's questions and answer\nsession.","type":"Document"}

Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji\nIt is natural for everybody to desire to earn money.\nEqually, there are many people who want to spend their\nwealth for dharmic (charitable) causes.\nHowever, many people do not know how to get these\ntwo objectives right. In the first place, they want to\nacquire wealth somehow; that is, if they cannot earn it\nby righteous means, they do not mind doing so in\nquestionable ways.\nObviously, this is wrong. Everybody must clearly\nunderstand that money should be earned only by\nlegitimate means and not in unjustifiable ways.\nSecondly, it is all right to long to do good things in\nlife. But one should not think that one can acquire\nwealth in illegal ways and spend it for dharmic causes.\nDoing good things with money earned by legitimate\nmeans alone is ideal.\nThus, dharma and artha (charity and wealth) should\nbe complementary to each other. Wealth must be earned\nby righteous means and such wealth alone should sponsor\ndharmiccauses.\nOne who follows this ideal will attain bliss in this\nworld as also in the otherworld.\nmeJe&Lee Oece&cetueesLe&e Oece& 1/2eeLe& Heefjuene~\nFlejslej3eesveealeew efJeefx cesIeesoOeer 3eLee~~\n(Courtesy : Tattvaloka)\nRighteous Earning Essential for Charity\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

The state of God-realisation is one ocean of\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202220\nbliss licking the flying spray of whose wavelet\neven the chief gods like Indra consider themselves\nsupremely rewarded. Sages have attained to\nfulfilment by tasting that essence in the depths\nof their\nhearts set completelye at rest.\nWhen the aspirants' internal being of\nperception melts and becomes one with this\nocean of everlasting bliss he is to be looked upon\nnot merelye as a knower of Brahman but Brahman\nitself.  The state of such a rare person, the true\nGuru is adored by the king of gods--what to speak\nof ordinary human beings.\nThis is my firm conviction.\nThe main Vedanta sadhana is covered through\nShravana, manana and nididhyasana. Having dealt\nwith them in the first three verses in a\ncharacteristically samvit fashion, we find, as soon as\nwe enter into the next shloka, that the steep incline\nis over and a vast beautiful meadow invites us to run.\nNote the wordsefveJe&=leceevemeeand JeefvoleHeoewhich, through\nthe symbol of mind and feet at rest-mind being\nfulfilled in itself and feet being worshipped by the\ngods-speak of the state of the realised one, the guru,\nin his uttermost perfection. They present us, as it\nwere, with the last snapshots of the guru caught in\ntwo preciously rare moments.\nIn one we see him steeped in meditation, in an\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202221\nunbroken absorption in the supreme effulgence that\nlights up the entire world. His mind has caught fire\nand is being consumed into utter fulfilment, turned\ninto something beyond all transformations. This is\nwhat happens to the poornahuti material after it has\nbeen offered in the sacrificial fire as the last oblation.\nScriptures say it becomes amrita, nectar.\nSought by Sadhakas\nIn the second picture we see the Guru in a different\npose. He is not meditating but is being meditated\nupon; he is no more a sadhaka, all sadhakas are\nseeking him, worshipping his feet. His state is an ocean\nof bliss.\nHow can one become Brahman? Whatsoever\nbecomes anything, that cannot be Brahman the\nunmodified. True, but truer is the fact that this yogi\nbecomes Brahman. The only thing you can do is to\ncease talking of it, slip into the situation and see. Slip\ninto it as a hail into the ocean, as Sri Shankaracharya\nsays in the Viveka-choodamani\nThat I Am\nSo, fulfilment comes by seeing through the details;\nneither by seeing details nor by not seeing them. The\nfulfilment of a knower of Brahman can thus be\nglimpsed through that very ordinary and seemingly\nglamourless experience of recognising an old\nacquaintance because in this you are using the same\nfaculty ofpratyabhijnawhich comes to play in revealing\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202222\nBrahman as 'That I am.'\nIt is unfortunate that you do not retain the pure\nexultation and unifying power of consciousness of that\nmoment of recognition. You proceed to become\nintimate by weaving the new details on that fine thread\nof unchangeableness and eternity of the conscious\nentity that is your friend. ''What are you doing?\nMarried? How many children?\"--In this obsession of\ndetails joy is lost, the simple joy of a deathless contact.\nThe Brahmajnani does not commit this mistake.\nHe has overcome this weakness of yielding to details,\nhe knows Uo3ee#eosnefJe<e3ee that details are shimmering\nin borrowed light. This is the characteristic of the\nfulfilled. He has no more bondage, nothing more to\nwork for, neither to obtain nor to avoid, efveJe=&leceevemee\nnirvrita manasaha.\nShimmering Consciousness\nYou do not perceive things, your light of the Self\nstreaming though the sense organs gives reality to\nthem through perception. So all that goes to make\nperception is your streaming and your shining, that\nis all. The former is a tumult or swell in the mental\nstuff, which is called vritti.

The forest looked so different from day time\nwhen the sun streamed in through the thick canopy and\nformed patterns on the forest floor. The  cheerful songs of\nbirds and bright sunshine in the daytime gave the forest a\ndifferent hue. But darkness brought about an eerie mystery to\nthe entire region! The raucous of night insects broke through\nthe silence now and then.\nThe owlets had sharp eyes and even sharper ears - so as they\nflew across the forest, they could hear every little noise that\nerupted now and then. Raj flew fast and soon disappeared\nfrom sight. Santu flew to race his friend, Raj. Chintu was soon\nleft behind but he was enjoying the flight.\nSuddenly, Chintu heard something. His sharp ears had\ndetected that something was not all quite alright here. He\nflew to where the sound was coming from.  \"Oh, it is a baby\nrabbit!\"\nSure enough, a tiny baby was stuck in a trap. It was some kind\nof a net in which the poor animal was trapped. Chintu flew\nright next to the baby rabbit and said, \"How did you get into\nthis trap? What's your name?\"  The poor rabbit murmured,\n\"My name is Gontu.  Amma had warned me not to get out of\nthe burrow.

In a trice,\nChintu picked up the net in his powerful talons and flew up -\njust as the hyena came bounding towards them.\nGontu was very heavy  for Chintu - after all, Chintu was a\nlittle owlet himself! But he remembered what Anamma ,\n\"You have such powerful talons, that you'll be surprised by\ntheir strength!\"\nChintu lifted Gontu just above the reach of the hyena and\nplaced the net on a thick branch of a banyan tree. Chintu sat\nclose to the little one and began to regale him with Anamma's\nstories.  Gontu was absolutely delighted. Hours passed by and\nsoon it was dawn.\nThe first bird began to sing much\nbefore the first rays of the sun\nreached the earth. The forest soon\ncame to life with birds singing and\nanimals moving about. Suddenly\nGontu, who was looking down\nfrom his perch shouted, \"Amma! I\nam here!

There are as many as 200 species of owls\naround the world!\nWhen a group of owls gets together, it's called a\nparliament or a congress or, less commonly, a stare.\nHave you noticed how wide an owl's eyes are? Owls\nactually don't have eyeballs. Their eyes are long and\nshaped more like a tube, which restricts them from\nmoving them in their sockets. Owls have binocular\nvision to help them focus on their prey, perceive the\ndepth and then swoop on it.\nOwls may have amazing eyes, but it's their ears that do\nthe real work when hunting. Many owls have\nasymmetrical ears. Their ears are located at different\nheights on their heads, so it makes it easier for them\nto comprehend the location of multiple sounds.\nOwls can rotate their necks 270 degrees, 135 degrees\non either side.\nThey are known as silent fliers--they must be\ncompletely quiet if they want to swoop in on fast-\nFun Facts:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202239\nmoving, far-off prey. To accomplish this, they have\nbroad wings; with very soft feathers that allow them\nto glide, minimizing the flapping sound that creates\nmost of the noise from a flying bird.\nOwls opt to nest in cavities of trees,  or where\nwoodpeckers have already made holes or natural\nholes in trees that are comfortable enough to make a\nnest.\nOwls have zygodactyls feet; this means two toes point\nfront and two point backwards. All toes have sharp,\nhooked claws known as talons. These give them an\neasy grip and a powerful grasp.\nFemale owls are larger, heavier and more aggressive\nthan the males. They are also more richly coloured\n(which is just the opposite of the other bird species\nwhere males have colourful plumage and attractive\ncolours) and also have a higher voice.\nNot all species of owls are nocturnal. Many times, you\nmight just spot an owl in the day peeping out from its\nhome on the tree. When there is a shortage of food,\nowls may hunt at any time during the day, especially\nthe Collared owlet.\nThe Elf Owl which is only 5-6 inch tall is the tiniest owl\nin the world. The Great Gray Owl which is 32 inch tall\nis the largest of all owls.\nThe colour of an owl's feather helps him camouflage or\nmix with the environment.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202240\n*\n*\nAll species of Owls do not hoot.

In effect, the significance is the\nsame. If one gets enmeshed in worldly wealth, one loses\ntouch with the adhyatmik. On the other hand excessive greed\nfor wealth gives rise to negativity, jealousy, avarice, vanity. So\nthe owl warns us to utilise wealth wisely, but not get\nentangled in the web of greed and desire and to fly above\nsuch worldly pitfalls.\nThe Shri Mahalakshmi Temple of Kolhapur is one of\nthe Shakti Peethas, situated on the banks of the\nPanchganga river. It is the abode of Lord Vishnu and\nDevi Mahalakshmi, as described in the Karveera\nMahamaya. The temple architecture indicates the\nKannada Chalukya empire, probably first built in circa\n700 AD. Epigraphic references place the deity in the\n7th century CE and the temple in the 10th century CE.\nFor a period, this temple had fallen out of worship due\nto invaders, but worship was restored in the year 1715\nafter the Marathas rose to power.\nMounted on a stone platform, the image of the four\narmed and crowned goddess is made of gemstone and\nweighs about 40 kilograms. The image of Mahalakshmi\ncarved in black stone is 3 feet tall. .

In her lower right\nhand, the deity of Mahalakshmi holds  a mhalunga (a citrus\nfruit), in the upper right, a large mace (kaumodaki) with its\nhead touching the ground, in the upper left a shield (khetaka)\nand in the lower left, a bowl (panpatra).\n Legend has it that Kolhasura, a fox-like demon, tormented\nthe Gods and other beings\nand was destroyed by Devi\nMahalakshmi at Karavira. At\nhis death, he became\nrepentant and was granted a\nboon , due to which this\narea became a thirtha,\nknown by his name , where\nthe Devi took up her abode,\nenshrined in the temple.\nThe Garuda mandap, dating\nback to the 18 th century,\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202244\nhas square pillars and foliated arches of wood, characteristic\nof Maratha temples.  The main mandap  faces west, with a\ncentral one for Mahalakshmi, with Mahakali and\nMahasaraswathi on either side.\nThe mortarless construction indicates early Deccan temple\nstyle and is adorned with Deepamalas and sculptures, while\nhorizontal mouldings and vertical offsets  create a rich light\nand shade pattern.\nThe temple complex has  shrines housing Shiva Lingam,\nNandi, Venkatesha, Katyayani and Gowri Shankar, the\nNavagrahas, Surya, Mahishasuramardini, Vitthal-Rakhumai,\nShiva, Vishnu, Tulja Bhavani Visweshwar Mahadev and others.\nSome of these images date back to the 11th century, while\nsome are of recent origin. Located in the courtyard is the\ntemple tank Manikarnika Kund.\nEven though the temple was built thousands of years ago, the\nKirnaotsava demonstrates the true genius of the architect.\nThe deity faces west (Pashchim), where through a small\nwindow the light of the setting sun falls on the image for\nthree days around Ratha Saptami. On the first day, sunlight\ntouches her feet, on the second her chest, the face and her\ncomplete body on the last day.\nThe temple has stood testimony to the faith of thousands of\ndevotees for hundreds of years.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam November 202245\n@\nCredits:\nWe welcome your feedback at\nYour feedback is important to us!\n Dil\nLittle Ravikiran created with love by Chandrima Kalbag and Jyothi\nBharat Divgi\nO wl pictures by Dr .

Shankar Rau visited Bombay about two\nyears ago, he apparently discussed with Karnad\nDayanad the subject of the Golden Jubilee\nCelebrations. He mentioned this to us when he came\nto Shirali some time later. The Silver Jubilee of our\nOrdination had been celebrated with some austerity.\nAccordingly, we felt that the Golden Jubilee\nCelebrations would also take place without much ado,\nand hence we agreed to the proposal. Had we known\nat that time that the present celebrations would be\non this large scale, we would not have given our\nconsent because we consider that we do not deserve\nit. Although from our point of view these celebrations\nare unnecessary, we concede that one good point has\nemerged from it. We refer to the proposal to commence\na Scholarship Fund to commemorate the occasion.\nWe console ourselves that at least this one gesture\nhas made the celebrations worthwhile.\nAs stated earlier, we do not consider ourselves\nworthy of a function such as today's, but the love and\nregard with which we are held by the laity is\nmanifested by the magnitude of the gathering.

In\nthis case, even the insignificant virtues of the beloved\nperson are magnified. Regarding good souls,\nBhartrihari says:\nHejiegCeHejceeCetved HeJe&leerJeaAl3e efvel3eced~\nefvepeEefoefJeJeAmevle: meeqvle mevle: efJeA3evlee~~\n[\"How many good souls are there who see\nmountains in the molehills of insignificant virtues in\nothers and take pleasure?\"] Such good souls are rare,\nis the implication. Bhartrihari is of the view that most\npeople underestimate good qualities in others. We\nfeel that he would not have raised the above\nquestion had he known our Community!\nWe take it that the homage paid to us today is an\nexpression of the love and regard you have for the\nMath and our religion. In manifesting joy on the\ncompletion of 50 years since our ordination, we feel\nthat you have expressed in no uncertain terms your\ndesire to perpetuate this institution. The Math was\nestablished by our ancestors to propagateacharand\nvichar. The propagation of knowledge(vichar) is being\ndone by several institutions. Hence, for this purpose\nalone, we do not feel there is any need for a separate\ninstitution. However, there is a need for an\ninstitution to propagate Pravritti Dharma (achar).\nHence, we feel that it may be opportune now for us to\nsay a few words on the subject of Pravritti Dharma.\nIn Pravritti Dharma, the main essentials are\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202411\nSandhyavandan and other daily rituals as well as the\nceremonies performed subsequent to one's birth, for\nexample, cradling etc. Some such essential ceremonies\nand rituals are mentioned not only in our Vedic\nDharma but also in other religions. If one notes the\nimportance given in the Bhagavad-Gita to the modes\nof behaviour of different castes and family traditions\nobtaining in a given country, one finds how important\ndaily religious performances are from the viewpoint\nof Varnashram Dharma. While the evils of war to Lord\nKrishna, Arjuna says:\nJegAue#e3es OeCeM3eeqvle JegAueOecee&: meveelevee:~\nOecex veas JegAueb JeaAlmveceOeceexcefYeYeJel3egle ~~\noes<ewjslew: JegAueIveeveeb JeCe&me1jJeAejJewA:~\nGlmeeDevles peeefleOecee&: JegAueOecee&M(r)e MeeMJelee:~~\n[\"Destruction of families leads to the destruction\nof the families' ancient Dharmic traditions. By the\ndestruction of one's Dharma, impiety results. By these\nmisdeeds of the destroyers of the family, bringing\nabout the confusion of castes, the ancient religious\ntraditions of caste and family are destroyed.\"] These\nwords were spoken by Arjuna. As Lord Krishna did\nnot comment thereon, one can safely infer that the\nviews expressed by Arjuna on the importance of the\nDharmic traditions of castes and families are valid. In\nevery deed, there are imperfections; so too are there\nimperfections in wars as pointed out by Arjuna.\nNevertheless, being a holy war for the preservation of\nrighteousness, Lord Krishna succeeded in persuading\nArjuna to fight the battle, and not because he had no\nfaith in the religious principles concerning castes and\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202412\nfamilies. The religious scriptures have laid down the\nobservance of many daily rituals and other ceremonies.\nNowadays, it is not possible to observe all of them.\nHence, only the most important of these are now in\nvogue. Considering the present circumstances, the\nobservance of at least these minimum rituals and\nceremonies would help in the propagation and\nperpetuation of Dharma.\nAmong the daily rituals and the five essential\nceremonies may be mentioned Sandhyavandan, Pitra\nand Manushya yajna. Meditation of the Lord Almighty\nis achieved by the performance of Gayatri japa. Manu\nsays (in Manu Smriti) that this japa is very important\nfor all Brahmins:\npeeh3esvewJe leg mebefmeO3esod ye'eieCees vee$e mebMe3e:~\nJegA3e&ov3eVeJee JegA3ee&vcew$ees ye'eieCe G(r)3eles ~~\n[\"A Brahmim achieves his goal by performing japa\nalone. There is no doubt about this. He may or may\nnot perform other deeds. A real friend is regarded as\nBrahmin.\"] A true Brahmin is one who deserves\neternal salvation. For this reason, he should befriend\nall. He should hate none. In attempting to amass\nwealth by hoarding large stocks of grain and other\nsupplies, he causes hardships to others and thus\nincurs their enmity. This is not conducive to fostering\nfriendship. For japa, only two things are needed :\nspeech and heart.  These do not adversely afftect\nothers. Thus, Manu is of the view that meditation\nthrough japa is most important to Brahmins. Daily\nobservance of Pitra yajna is now not in vogue.But the\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202413\nperformance without fail of annual obsequies is\nessential. Manu says that the debt owed by children\nto their parents for giving birth to them, for hardships\nundergone in bringing them up, and for giving them\neducation etc. can never be repaid even if they serve\nthem well during their entire lifetime. Therefore, it is\nnecessary as also beneficial to perform the annual\nobsequies in memory of the various benefits received\nfrom the parents who are no more. Manushya yajna\nmeans hospitality. It is inherent in our people to offer\nhospitality to their guests. This hospitality, if\nperformed religiously instead of as a social duty,\nbecomes Manushya yajna. The deity contemplated in\nSandhyavandan is the same as the one served through\nthe observance of the five essential ceremonies. Manu\nenumerates the benefits of performing the five\nessential ceremonies, along with other rituals, as\nfollows:\ncene3e%ew 1/2e 3e%ewMedye'eieer3eb ef!eA3eles levege~\n[\"The state of mind necessary to achieve salvation\ncan be attained by performing the five essential\nceremonies.\"]\nAmong the occasional ceremonies, mention may\nbe made of cradling, thread ceremony, marriage and\nthe last rites. In this context, the word Sanskara has\ntwo connotations: one to ward off defects and the\nother to foster virtues. On this subject, Manu observes\nas follows:\nThe various essential ceremonies, concerning\nBrahmins to purify them in this world and in future\nlives, should be performed by the chanting of\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202414\nauspicious Vedic mantras. By the performance of\ncertain rituals-such as those of Jdtakarma, tonsular\nceremony, thread ceremony etc- a Brahmin cleanses\npaternal (baijik)  as well as maternal (garbhik)\nimpurities.\"\nIf the laity perform these ceremonies properly and\nregularly, they will not only derive benefits therefrom\nbut also support the Vaidiks. On this occasions, it is\npertinent to make a suggestion. The laity, while\nperforming thread ceremonies and marriages, grudge\noffering suitable emoluments to Vaidiks but spend\nlavishly on non-essential entertainment. This is not\nproper. It seems justifiable to limit one's expenses on\nentertainment in order to limit one's expenses on\nentertainment in order to adequately compensate the\nVaidiks. They have no fixed monthly income. It is\nthrough these earnings alone that they have to see\nthrough the entire year's expenses.\nToday, the Shishya (Swami Parijnanashram) has\ndelivered a speech paying homage to us. He has a\nkeener intellect and memory than we have. If he\nmeans it, he could run this institution better than\nwe have been able to do. That God may be pleased\nto bless him is our earnest prayer.\nMay the religious fervour manifested at this\ngathering endure and increase. May your religious\nconduct bring you prosperity. May your reverence for\nthe Math ever increase and bring you the choicest\nblessings. This is our prayer at the feet of the\nParamatman.\n(First published in Sunbeam April 1965)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

But, in all our\nAshirvachans, our emphasis has been on Bhakti and\nGod-remembrance rather than Dharma, Jnana\netc.You may have heard of the well-known story of\nSwami Vivekananda, who, on his return to India from\na successful lecture tour abroad, was asked by a\ndevotee why he did not speak here on our ancient\nculture, religion, and preach to our people what he\nhad preached to foreigners abroad. His reply was that\nhe did not feel it proper to preach to the people of\nthis country about Vaidic rites and rituals and Dharma\netc., when they were so much immersed in poverty\nand other miseries or tell them how they should\nworship, observe the scriptural rules etc. What they\nneeded more was guidance on how they could forget\ntheir miseries and wordly travails and attain\nhappiness. This quotation of Swami Vivekananda is\napt here and illustrates why the emphasis in all our\nAshirvachans has been more on the practical side of\nhow the householder can follow the path of Bhakti in\nhis every-day life through God-remembrance etc.\nMoreover, in present-day times and the hectic lives\nled by most people, few are interested in mere\nexpositions on what is Brahman, what is Shakti etc.\nTherefore, we have been speaking everywhere on how\nour people can follow simple rules of Sadhana in their\nday-to-day life, whereby they can both alleviate and\nelevate their life as a whole and march on the Godward\npath.\nFirstly, we should have faith in God. We do not\nalways retain a firm rocklike faith in God. Therefore\nwe should first recognise that there is God, there is\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202417\nGuru, there is Dharma etc. Each one's Sadhana or\nspiritual effort depends on his own capacity. Who is\nthis God of whom we speak? He is one Paramatman,\none Divine Power who runs the whole universe, who\ncontrols our destinies and makes us perform both good\nand \"bad\" deeds. The scriptures describe such a\nSupreme Being thus - \"He is with form, He is without\nform; He is with attributes, He is attributeless; He is\nEternal Power, who is Beginningless and beyond the\nconfines of time and space; He is Universal,\nOmnipresent, and even time and space are His\ncreation, used by Him for His Divine sport.\" Such a\nDivine Power should not be merely accepted by us as\nexisting, but should be realised within ourselves, in\nour mind and heart. We cannot measure Him in terms\nof time and space as He is infmite. He can be\nexperienced by us in the fullness of spiritual\nexperience, no matter what path we pursue, for He is\nall, in all and beyond all. All paths are His and lead\nonly to Him. In fact, He is very close to us, being within\nourselves, much nearer to us than we can ever\nimagine. All our effort should be to attain such a Divine\nPower. We call him as Rama, Krishna, Dattatreya etc.\nNo doubt, these Avatars did take birth on this earth\nto lead mankind to salvation. But, Brahma, Vishnu\nand Shiva were the names and forms that our ancients\ngave to the triple functions of the Supreme Being,\nnamely, Creation, Preservation and Destruction which\nis taking place all the while. Brahma, Vishnu and\nShiva were themselves children of Adi Shakti. They\nwere entrusted by Her with the three functions\nmentioned above, for the sake of Her divine sport.\nYet, Adi Shakti has Herself remained above and\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202418\nbeyond this cycle of creation, preservation and\ndestruction.\nLord Krishna tells us in the Gita:\nDevev3eeef 1/2evle3evlees ceeb 3es pevee: He3e&gHeemeles ~\nles<eeb efvel3eeefYe3egkeIleeveeb 3eesie#esceb Jenec3enced ~~\n(\"Those devotees, who, knowing no one else,\nconstantly think of Me, and worship Me, alone, to\nthose ever united in thought with Me, I bring full\nsecurity and personally attend to their needs\"). What\nHe teaches us in this Shloka is that whatever be our\nwork, whatever be our function, if with single-minded\ndevotion, we concentrate on Him and Him alone, He\nwill render us safe and secure (\"Yogakshemam\nVahamyaham\") There are troubles in the lot of\neveryone. Actually, there are devotees who pray to\nGod to give them troubles. Kunti's prayer to Krishna\nwas to give her always troubles and problems because,\nwe remember God only when troubles beset us. The\ndevotee tells the Lord \"give us troubles, they do not\nfrighten us, because Your thought runs in our mind,\nwe remember You often and we repeat Your name\noften.\" Kunti was one of the greatest devotees of Lord\nKrishna, and her prayer was the same.\nKrishna says that He has created this world for\nthe sake of His sport, at the same time He has endowed\nman with powers to resist the lure of this creation. It\nby resisting the worldly pleasures, man attains Him,\nthen He assures him of all happiness. Instead, if man\nconcentrates only on the worldly pleasures, he\nremains rooted to this cycle of birth and death. Having\ncome on this worldly stage, he remains on the stage\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202419\nitself. The Bhagwat and other Puranas have been\nwritten by our ancients for our benefit. They speak of\nthe glories of the Lord and describe His divine sport.\nKrishna is known by many names - Gopala, Govinda.\nHis Lila is meant to turn our minds towards Him.\nKrishna's life has many facets- He is the divine thief\nwho steals butter, he is the divine Lover who has\nthousands of Gopis mad of Him, while as the King,\nthough He has his own kingdom, Krishna gets Himself\ninvolved in the affairs and politics of others and strives\nfor their welfare. He is also portrayed as the warrior\nwho displays His immense powers m war. Again,\nmougn a ksnatrwa, tie become tne great Teacher. Yet,\nin all these activities, He remains the Supreme Lord.\nHe is calledGovinda, namely, One who draws us away\nfrom the Indriyas, which are pulled by the outside\nworld. In all His Names and activities, the syllable \"Go\"\nis repeated everytime: Gopal, Govind, Govardhan ,\nGolad. The great Lord is shown as the stealer of butter.\nAt first hearing, it sounds absurd. He was a royal\nPrince, why did He have to go to others' house to break\npots and steal butter when He could have had as much\nbutter as He wanted in His own house? What sort of a\nGod was He then?\nWe can look at it this way. Our body is the pot\nwhich is filled with Void (Akash). When this pot breaks,\nthe Void within merges with the Void outside and they\nbecome one. Krishna is protrayed as breaking this\npot, namely, this feeling that one is the body, and\nstealing the butter from within. The butter is His\nrealisation that comes alter churning the sour\nSansar of life. Krishna's Lilas include the incident of\nHis stealing the clothes of the Gopis and hiding them\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202420\nin a tree. How could the Lord do such a thing? Here,\nyou should not go by the apparent meaning. \"Gopi\"\nneed not be a woman alone. Anyone who strives for\nHim is a Gopi. Only in recent times, the term \"vastra\"\nis taken to mean only clothes. Everyone is clothed in\nthree desires (S<eCee$e3e) - the desire for wife and family,\nthe desire for wealth and the desire for name and\nfame. They are the three \"Vasanas\" and, one who is\nclothed in these three Vasanas(Jemeve) is known as one\nwearing a vastra\". Man may overcome the first two\ndesires but the last desire, that for name and fame,\ncannot be easily given up. Hence, Krishna, the Beloved\nLord and Lover of His devotees, is depicted as removing\nthe three Vasanas (\"Vastra\") from the devotee (Gopi)\nso that he may look up at Him and attain salvation.\nKrishna's names have meanings of their own. He\nis known as Gopal, or One who deliberately draws\nour eyes outside for the sake of His divine sport. He is\nknown as Govardhan or One who continuallly tests\nus by giving us attractions outside. He is known as\nGovind or One who teaches us that we are not the\nIndriyas, that we are not the transitory things in life.\nAll these are Krishna. To understand such a Lord,\nsuch a Krishna, we should always do His\nremembrance, Namasankirtan. We should always\nremember Him, we should dwell on His glories, on\nHis divine sport. Once we understand Him and realise\nHim, we can always dwell in Him, and our struggle\nfor happiness is ended and we attain eternal peace\nand happiness and we remain His devotees always\nand thus vindicate this human birth of ours.\nFor the last two days and two nights that we have\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202421\nstayed here, we have been treated with all love and\ndevotion by the laity here. The enthusiasm of the\nvolunteers was touching and we felt the same joy and\nsatisfaction that we did when we came last on an\nofficial tour with His Holiness Swami Anandashram\nten years ago.

Then another\nmoment to regulate his breath and then vocalize.\nThis is the third level -  Madhyama. And the fourth\nis uttered speech called Vaikhari. To exercise some\ncontrol over our uttered speech, we could perform\njapa and chanting. When uttered speech is stopped,\nwe realize there is chaos. It is our duty to bring in\nsome balance there. Mantra japa happens at that\nlevel. There is no uttered speech and it happens at\nthe mental level.\n- Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh 2022\nVani - Bringing in refinement in thought\nand speech\nSpeech is being relentlessly used. Brainlessly\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202425\nused. Such being the case, we do not have, forget\npoise and control, even awareness of what we speak.\nWhen you ask, \"You said this didn't you?\" (I say)\n\"Oh! I do not recall what I said!\" \"But you said this\njust now, didn't you?\" It's like I'm not responsible\nfor my speech. It has happened. If it happens, then\nall unpleasant things will start happening! So, first\nbecoming aware - this is wrong, I should not speak\nlike this. When you begin to become aware of that\nhow do you bring in the control? Compensation. If\nI use so much amount of Vani and in that I'm trying\nto bring in some purity, okay, a refinement in my\nthoughts, but I'm not being particularly successful,\nthen at least I'll compensate by speaking something\nof worth. \"Oh! I'm unable to think of good thoughts.\nWhat shall I do?\" That is why the stotras are there\nno?

Second,\nbecause of our samskaras, what we understand to\nbe the truth, we may not be able to express that\ntruth as it is, probably due to our hesitation. That\nis why Vani gets contaminated or gets wasted. So\nhere, a prayer is being expressed - when Vani is\nbeing used, may my goal be good as well. To speak,\nto also increase my power of expression. And in fact\nPara Vani which is the form of that Divine Grace\nand may only that be expressed as the uttered,\nvaikhari. In this manner, the sadhaka focuses,\ncontrols his speech, uses it well in the mundane\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202426\nspoken words and specially during Anushthanan,\nstotra chanting etc., increases mantra japa, then She\nis pleased and truly begins to shower Her Grace.\nAnd it is a two-way process. We listen to the Guru's\nwords. The intellect that we use to listen, absorb,\nwith the same intellect we express what we have\nheard. In expressing if there is ambiguity then there\nis bound to be a problem in the absorption as well.\nThat is why if we focus on getting some clarity in\nour effort to express, chanting of stotras with some\nstrength. As it is informed in the Shivmahimna\nstotra- who can glorify you ? Not even Brahma and\nothers can do that and I am just a Gandharvaraj.\nWhat stuti am I capable of? But even then I try.\nOne, I have bhakti and the other is that I have the\nresolve- By glorifying You with my Vani, I only purify\nmy Vani even more. By uttering the Shiva nama\nmantra, the speech gets purified. Oh God! That is\nwhy, I glorify You. This is selfish, but this selfishness\n- is about what ? With respect to the Ultimate Truth.\nNothing to do with the person. This kind of\nselfishness is not to be discarded. We are protected\nby it.\n- Shankarlok 2023\nGlorifying Ishwara is Purifying Vani\nIt is not possible to describe Ishwara. Even if we\nglorify Him, it does not really do justice to His\nsplendor. Is it not so? A King comes to a village and\nthe Chief of the village calls everybody together and\ntells them - \"You know I am the Chief of your\nvillage; similarly there is another village bigger than\nthis. This King is the Chief of that village.\" Then is\nthe King being glorified there? The village is so\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202427\nsmall. The power or splendor of the Chief of that\nvillage is negligible compared to the power of the\nKing. In the same way, if we try to glorify Ishwara,\nthere is no point in that. The question arises - Then\nwhy am I glorifying Him? Then Pushpadantacharya\nsays - The source from where my mind, my speech\ncomes, if I try to glorify That Source, then such a\npurity and brilliance starts manifesting in my mind\nand speech that I feel totally Blessed! Whenever I\nthink generally, I think of objects, when I speak, I\ntalk about objects only. So, the impurities that are\npresent in those objects, they seep into my mind\nand my speech. But that which is Nirguna - bereft\nof attributes, that which is not an object, that which\nis the Brahma tattva, the Shiva swarupa, if I\nmeditate upon That, try to glorify That, then my\nmind starts getting a kind of strength and my\nspeech starts getting a purity. That is why I insist\non glorifying Him. I do it with love too and I know\nthat to the extent that purity comes into my mind,\nmy speech, to that extent I can understand This\nShiva swarupa. And if I glorify the Shiva-swarupa,\nthen that purity comes into my mind and my\nspeech. Therefore I glorify Him.\n- Shirali 2022\n(Transcribed by Shrikala Kodikal)\nMAHA SHIVARATRI AT SCM SHIRALI\nP. P.

The elephant is a symbol of power\ntempered with wisdom and benign majesty.\nThe fact stressed here is, the Lord can be\nworshipped only by those who have not only the power\nof action but also spiritual perception, a buddhi that\naccepts Shiva and Shakti as the obverse and reverse\nof the same truth.\n22)  iepe(r)eceexpJeueekeA=efle:\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202430\nWhose form is resplendent with the coat of\nelephant skin.

Taking a\nterrible form the Lord is said to have jumped upon\nthe asura and, in a trice, ripped him apart merely\nwith His nails, thus outwitting the demon's boon that\nmade him invulnerable to any weapon. When the\ndying asura's chastened spirit prayed to be forgiven\nand redeemed by the Lord's acceptance, Shiva\ngraciously agreed to wear hisskin as a shawl. More\nthan the aesthetic aspect of Shiva's white radiance\nset off by the dark covering of the elephant hide, what\nimpresses one is the Lord's power of quick\npunishment becoming more radiant through His ready\nforgiveness and loving acceptance of a gesture of\ndevotion, however late or light it may be.

This\ncharming sight holds a spiritual insight. Ganga is so\ncalled because she is the celestial stream brought down\nto earth (ieeb ielee Fefle iebiee). She was an immense potential\nlying uselessly in the heavens, like a galactical dust\ncloud. She was named by Kapilamuni as the only\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202431\nmeans of redeeming the sons of King Sagara, who\nwere burnt by the sage's curse, due to their own\ninadvertance. Sagara's son Anshuman and grandson\nDilipa, spent their entire life vainly trying to propitiate\nthe river. It was Bhagiratha, of the fourth generation,\nwho succeeded. But the earth was not capable of\nwithstanding the force of her impact. Thus Ganga's\nagreeing to come down created a problem of shock-\nabsorption, for whichBhagirathawas advised to invoke\nShiva's grace. He succeeded in this also. Entering into\nthe forest of Lord's matted locks, Ganga's pride was\nshattered and she was too stunned to move, that is\nhow she got the name Mandakini  - \"of sluggish\nmotion\". Later, when released she flowed freely as\nAlakananda - joy of the Lord's matted hair. Ate the\nsame time, the earthly touch made Ganga muddy,\nand in turn that mud heightened the cololur-effect of\nShiva's tawny coils of hair piled on the head. Whether\nit is foam or mud, anything accepted by the Lord,\nappears beautiful. Like Ganga, all worldly goodness\nis tinged with the possibility of catastrophe. It is the\ntouch of Shiva , the all - compassionate, that\ntransforms it into universal good, and a divine\ndecoration (seeShiva Mahimnastotra, Shloka fourteen)\nThere is poetry in the words of name twenty-three.\nGanga is divya because of the anga (limbs) of the Lord\nwhich she touches. In turn the anga becomes dhavala\n(white) due to Ganga. Our actions are purified only\nby offering them to the Lord. And the Lord graciously\ntakes upon himself the colour of our karma and bhava.\n25)  ieieveecyejmebJeerle:\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202432\nHe who is enclosed by the cloth of space. If cloth\ncovers completely, it becomes a shroud, fit for a corpse.\nLiving bodies are partly covered by a dress that is\nmeant to conceal discretely and allow the use of the\nvarious limbs meaningfully. Dress is meant to protect\nthe body and to bring out the personality. For us cloth\nis a culture. Hence it is significant that, with all his\npowers of innovative and insatiable thirst for variety,\nthe Indian sticks to dhoti and sari, a single piece of\ncloth that can be fashioned in various ways, according\nto the individual's taste and occasion. Creation is\nsomething like that. It is one space, pulsating with\npotential for infinite change. Science too maintains\nthat space is the fabric of life. Lord accepts this entire\ncreation and uses it. Not to cover himself, but, to\nexpress his Divine personality.\nSpace is not enclosed; even walls of mountains\ncannot restrict it; where the wall is, there too space\nis. Hence space is a principle which allows all\ntransactions, but does not itself get transformed. It\nsounds strange that Lord uses such a subtle,\nunenclosable space as an enclosure. This amounts to\nsay,  that he is not covered at all, \"Nothingness\nencloses him\". This is meant to convey the idea that\nhe is Ananta and Akhanda. He is Akasha Lingo, that\nis, he uses akasha to express his nature, just as we\nidentify a policeman through his uniform, so the Lord\nhas akasha as his linga, a dress.\nIn a grossly literal depiction of this, Shiva is\npictured as naked ascetic. But one should remember\nthat, this Digambara is also Chidambara, that the\n\"nothingness\" which encloses Him is a spiritual space.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202433\n26)  ieieveecegkeIlecetOe&pe:\nWhose unloosened locks of hair fill the skies.\nIn the earlier name, mention has been made about\nthe Jata of Lord Shiva . The matted locks of hair\ndistinguish the ascetic and symbolize Tapas. Even\ntoday many ascetics strive to turn the untended growth\nof hair into a jata, by using the milk of the banyan\ntree. Incidentally, the banyan itself is a tree that has\njatasand is considered holy. Ascetics prefer to practice\nunder it, like Shri Dakshinamurti Himself.\nApart from the inferences we make about the\npsychic effects of having jata on the head, it obviously\nspeaks about a way of life in which the external niceties\nand vanities of life and the care of the body are given\nup. We have already seen, with respect to name twenty-\nfour, that the Lord received and absorbed the impact\nof Ganga's descent with his jaM. We also absorb the\nshocks of life(Uvo DeeIeele) through titiksha (forbearance).\nThis is a positive spiritual discipline and not a negative\nsubmission or development of insensitivity. Titilcsha\nand tapasya conserve the potentials we have, awaken\nlatent powers and generate new spiritual energies.\nManu holds that the highest form of tapas is the\ncomplete concentration of mind and senses. The\nUpanishadadvises us: \"leHemee ye'ie efJeefpe%eememJe -seek to know\nthe Brahman through tapas.\" The knowledge so\ngained has to express itself in joyous streams of\nliberated life. That is why Shiva is fond of dancing.\nThe jatasplay a predominant role in Dance of Shiva.\nThose who have studied the various idols of Natandja\nhave discovered in them the depictions of different\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202434\ndances like the Ananda, the Sandhya, the Divya and\nthe Pralaya forms of Tandava. The difference is\nparticularly recognized through the shape of the Jatas.\nWe see the drooping, the straight and the upturned\njatcl of the Natardja. Apart from the position, the\nprofusion or sparseness, the jata is also the indication\nof the mood of the dance. The jatas of Shiva spanning\nthe breadth of the Prabhavali (the circular or parabolic\ncurve enclosing the Nataraja) and representing the\nspace of creation, remind one of the power-lines that\nscientists discover, in the vast outer space of the\nuniverse. Dr. Fritjof Capra is his well-known book \"'Tao\nof Physics\" has expatiated on this idea and it is worth\nstudying in this respect.\nWhen the season of rains (Chaturtnasya) begins,\nthey say Shiva has unloosened His locks of hair. In\nmany places rain clouds have been interpreted as the\nhair of the Virat Purusha. The loosened locks thus\nspeak of the down-pour of grace also.\n27) JeoveeypeefpeleeypeTheer:\nThe beauty of whose face wins over the lotus\nflower's magnificence.\n28) JeovesvogmHegAjefIMe:\nThe moon-like radiance of whose face illumines\nthe directions.\nSweetness and light are the traits of Truth. The\nvisage of the Lord brings out these two qualities, most\neminently. A person is recognized more easily by his\nface than by any other part of his body. The analogy\nof the lotus and the moon are common to any beautiful\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202435\nface and have to be understood in all its various\nimplications - of shape, colour, nature, time and effect.\nBy saying that the excellence of the lotus petals is\ninsignificant before the beauty of the Lord's face, we are\nreminded that the glory of the entire world is nothing\ncompared to that of the creator (refer to the Purusha\nSukta and the Vibhuti Yoga of the Bhagavad Gita).\nIn name twenty-eight, 'directions' may be taken\nto mean the instructions of the Guru and Shastras.\nThese two remain obscure without the direct presence\nof the Acharyamurti. It is His gracious look which\nenlightens the directions of spiritual outlook.\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy : Samvit Sadhanayana, Santa Sarovar, Mt. Abu)","type":"Document"}

It mitigates negativity and\ncreates positive vibes in the body, mind and soul of the\nperson wearing it. It creates a cocoon of energy around the\nperson wearing it. It ushers in peace and harmony.\nShravana:\nKeertana\nManana\nSource: Shiva Purana Part 1 by J. L.

Rukha means\nmisery and dravyati means to eradicate. Rudra is the one who\neradicates misery. In other words, Rudra transforms tears of\nsorrow into tears of bliss which is represented by the\nRudraksha.\nRudra is that consciousness that\nbrings tears of love, bliss, and\ngratitude. Aksha means tears.\nLord Shiva was in penance for a\nlong period, immersed in the\nblissful Self. When He woke up,\ntears fell on the ground from His eyes. The tears became a\nseed and grew into a tree, which came to be known as the\nRudraksha tree. The seeds of this tree were bestowed special\npowers by Lord Shiva, which can assist us in our spiritual\nevolution. The Shiva Purana states that the one who wears\nthe Rudraksha attains identity with Lord Shiva.\nThe Rudraksha tree (Elaeocarpus ganitrus) is a large\nevergreen tree mainly found in the foothills of the Himalayas.\nEndowed with anti-bacterial property, the leaves are used for\ntreating wounds and many other ailments. During winter, the\nfruits - shaped like berries and blue in colour - begin\nappearing on the tree. The Rudraksha beads are inside this\nfruit.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam February 202445\nCredits:\nLittle Ravikiran created with love by Nishtha Naimpally,\nPratima Rege, Chandrima Kalbag, Namrata Heranjal and\nJyothi Bharat Divgi\nEditor: Dr .

In\none of his writings, Pujya Papa has spoken glowingly\nof  the  influence  exerted  on  him  by  His  Holiness\nSrimad Pandurangashram Swamiji whose Darshan\nhe  had  when  he  was  yet  a  boy  of  tender  years.\nWriting of that experience, Papa said: \"Then another\ngreat spiritual event in his life was the visit of the\nSwami  of  Chitrapur  Math.  Chitrapur  Math  is  a\nspiritual  institution  belonging  to  the  Saraswat\nCommunity  in  which  Ramdas  had  his  birth.  The\nspiritual head of this Math and the community was\nat the time touring in the district. Ramdas had His\ndarshan and young though he was, he was keen on\nknowing all the details of the austere life of this\ngreat Swami. He used to watch the spiritual practices,\nthe usual routine activities of the Swami, with great\nkeenness and interest. Sometimes, a desire would\ncreep into his mind that since he found the Swami's\nlife was the ideal life, he should one day become\nlike Him. Of course this was to be taken as a boyish\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

But, there is significance in every\nlittle bit of experience and every contact that comes\nto us in our lives. Ramdas used to go for the darshan\nof this Swami two or three times every day and he\nfelt that the Swami was exerting on him a strange\nbut powerful fascination\" (Early life of Swami Ramdas.\nThe Vision, Vol-33:154). That childhood desire to\nemulate the example of Srimad Pandurangashram\nSwamiji was to bear fruit years later when Pujya\nPapa adopted Sannyas himself in his 39th year and,\nsnapping all worldly ties, attained universal vision,\nseeing his Beloved Ram in everyone and everywhere.\n   Between Pujya Papa and His Holiness Swami\nAnandashram also there always existed a strong\nbond of mutual love and regard. They met for the\nfirst time in Kasargod in the year 1929 and Papa\nsaw in Swami Anandashram (again, to quote his\nown words): \"A pure and illumined personality, ever\nradiating the light of high spiritual attainment.\nAlthough the Swamiji represents a particular\ncommunity, his vision is universal, since the views\nhe holds in religious matters are enlightened with\nthe rapidly evolved spirit of the times.\" (The Vision.\nVol 1.72). Swami Anandashram too expressed his\nown love and regard for Pujya Papa most beautifully\nand feelingly in the poem in Sanskrit composed by\nHim in 1947 for Pujya Papa's Sannyas Silver Jubilee\nSouvenir. The poem concludes thus: \"From Ramdas,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       18              December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nocean of wisdom, love, happiness and the like, may\nthe world, deriving bliss for long, attain to\nblessedness.\"\n   Swami Anandashram and Pujya Papa met, in all,\nfive or six times. Each tryst of theirs provided a rare\nspiritual enlightenment for the assembled devotees.\nThe two divinities met not only in Anandashram but\nalso in places like Kasargad and Bangalore when\nboth happened to be in town at the same time. This\nwas how Pujya Papa described their first meeting in\nKasargod in 1929: \"Swami Anandashram, the\nspiritual head of the Saraswat community, arrived at\nKasargod and took his residence in the precincts of\nSri Pandurang Temple. Of course, the members of\nthe Saraswat community went in large numbers for\nhis darshan. At the repeated pressure of a friend\namong them, Ramdas was also taken over to him for\ndarshan. Ramdas was made to take his seat opposite\nto him in an armchair in a small room on the first\nfloor of a house. The elite of the community had also\nassembled at the place. Ramdas duly honouring the\nSwamiji with salutation took his seat. At the first\nglance he discovered the Swamiji to be a pure and\ngreat soul. His handsome feature radiated the glow\nof spiritual light Ramdas felt perfectly free and blissful\nin his company. Without ceremony Ramdas started\nrecounting to him the incidents of his trip to Kashmir\nand Amarnath. In a few words Swamiji discoursed\nupon the siddhanta of Kashmiris, that is, of Shiva\nand Shakti. Soon after, Ramdas, taking leave of the\nSwamiji, returned to the Ashram. A few days later,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19              December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nSwamiji in company with his disciples paid a visit to\nAnandashram. The occasion was characteristic of his\nbroad mindedness and kind and affable nature. After\nspending an hour or there- abouts in Ramdas'\ncompany, during which Ramdas alone spoke a few\nwords on the value of solitude and satsang, the\nSwamiji left the ashram and went back to the\ntemple.\"  (In the Vision of God, Vol. II:285)    .\n   The next tryst of the two saints took place 15\nyears later, on 3rd December, when His Holiness\nwith retinue paid a visit to Anandashram at\nKanhangad in response to an invitation from Pujya\nPapa and Mataji and stayed for four days. A right\nroyal reception was accorded to H.H. and he was\ntaken in a procession amidst the singing of Ramnam\nchorus to the Ashram hall where Swami. Ramdas\nawaited him and received him with love and joy.\nDuring this four-day sojourn. H.H. took delight in\nclimbing the towering Manjapati hill behind the\nAshram and visiting the Ashram goshala, Vidyalaya\nand Industrial School founded by Pujya Papa. The\nvisit was highlighted by a discourse in Konkani by\nH.H. when He dwelt at length on Jnana Yoga and\nBhakti Yoga, quoting several appropriate shlokas of\nBhagavad Gita and said that while all the Yogas led\nto God realization, Bhakti Yoga was easiest to follow.\nH.H. departure was also marked by scenes of great\ndevotional fervour with the Ashram bungalow where\nH.H. had camped thronged with Ashramites and\nother devotees who came, one by one and paid their\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20             December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nhomage to His Holiness. Last came Pujya Papa and\nMataji and offered their love and respects to H.H. by\nbowing and touching His feet. Their next meeting\nwas in Bangalore on 1-11-1953 when both Papa,\nMataji and Swami Anandashram happened to be in\nthat city at the same time in course of their respective\ntours to the North. Pujya Papa and Mataji called on\nHis Holiness at the Math in Bangalore and were\nreceived by H.H. in His room adjacent to the\nverandah. After salutations, Pujya Papa was asked\nby Swamiji to take his seat on another sofa provided\nthere facing Swmiji's right. They spoke with each\nother for some time and, then, saluting H.H. again,\nPapa and Mataji left the Math for their own camp\n(Gospel of Swami Ramdas)        .\n   Swami Anandashram's second visit to the Ashram\nat Kanhangad came almost 11 years after the first\none when on 1st December 1957, he came to the\nAshram in response to an invitation from Pujya Papa\nand Mataji and, this time, stayed here for a full\nweek. Those were days of great rejoicing among the\nassembled devotees, and each day provided a new\nvista of spiritual fervour, gaiety and bliss. Reporting\nthe event, \"The vision,\" the Ashram magazine, said\nthus : 'Papa enjoys meeting saints. He often says\nthat he has great reverence for Sannyasins and\nwhenever he meets them, he prostrates before them\nand touches their holy feet. Asked why he should\ndo so. Papa replied, Ramdas is after all their child.\nFurther, he receives thousands of Namaskaras from\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       21             December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthousands of devotees daily. Whenever he finds a\nSannyasin, Ramdas passes all those Namaskars to\nhim. The Sannyasins shower their love on Ramdas.\nIn the company of saints, he get his huge vessel\nfilled with spiritual wealth and later he distributes\nit all to those who come to him. Before the vessel\nbecomes empty, some other saint comes and fills it.\"\n(Gospel of Swami Ramdas). Another five years were\nto pass before Swami Anandashram, this time along\nwith the Shishya Swami. Swami Parijnanashram\nvisited the Ashram again on April 14, 1962. On the\neve of their arrival, Pujya Papa expressed to an\nAshram inmate: \"Coming events cast their shadows\nbefore. Nay, there are no shadows here: in this case,\nthe coming event has cast its aura like the rays of\nthe rising sun that fill the sky just before the hour\nof the dawn.\" (The Vision, Vol: 29:297(. Once again\nthe same scenes of the loving welcome accorded by\nPapa and Mataji to The Holiness, again the\nspontaneous greetings by hundreds of Ashram\nworkers lining the path leading to the Bhajan Mandir\non either side and, once again, the scenes of rejoicing\neverywhere. This time also Swami Anandashram gave\na discourse in Konkani. The Swamiji prefaced his\ntalk with touching reference to Pujya Papa.

But, as Papa had requested him\nto say a few words, he would say something. His\nHoliness then discoursed on the path of Bhakti as\nlaid down by Lord Krishna in the Gita - the path\nwhich called for wholehearted devotion and surrender\nto the Lord.\n    This was the last time that Pujya Papa and Swami\nAnandashram met, for 15 months after this epochal\nvisit of Their Holinesses, Pujya Papa shed his physical\nbody on 25th July 1963. Among the first messages\nto be received in the orphaned Ashram was a\ntelegram from Swami Anandashram blessing that all\nthe activities founded by Pujya Papa go on as before\nin future as well. Swamiji also paid a visit to the\nAshram within two months, on 5th September 1963,\nand gave his blessing in person.\n     (First published in Sunbeam, September, 1981)\n\n               FESTIVALS IN JANUARY 2025\n\nJANUARY 2025\n\n05  Sunday          Dhanurvyatipata\n\n13  Monday          Vardhanti of Keelu Devata  installed near\n                    Go-Shala at SCM,Shirali\n\n14  Tuesday         Vardhanti at SCM,Bengaluru -\n                    Nagdevata/Annamma/Chamunda/\n                    Marikamba Sannidhis\n\n14  Tuesday         Makara Sankramana/Tilgul\n\n31  Friday          Samaradhana at SCM,Mallapur\n                    - Swami Shankarashram -II Sannidhi\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        23              December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

We  would  also  hear  the\npeople praise His Holiness's addresses, saying \"How\nwonderfully  Swamiji  has  spoken,  what  a  grand\nPravachan\" and so on. But when we asked any of\nthe listeners what exactly Swamiji spoke, none could\ntell us. All they could say was that it was a splendid\ndiscourse and so on. Why so? Because, the listeners\nwere  heedless  and  did  not  bother  to  understand\nand  imbibe  the  words  of  advice  spoken  by  His\nHoliness. They only heard but failed to heed. In\nthis life of ours, we need an oasis, a haven from\nworldly pains and difficulties and to fulfill this need\nor ours, our elders have laid down different methods\nof attaining peace of mind like Moorti Puja, Nama\nJapa etc. Idol worship is not necessary for people\nwho have already progressed on the spiritual path\nand have realized the true purpose of life but worship\nof a Name and Form is needed for those caught in\nthe whirlpool of worldly existence.

Once the\ndevotee has captured the sweetness of the Nama\nand acquired a taste for Sadhana, he is ready for the\nnext step on the spiritual path. He is then told that\nhe has to march ahead on the spiritual path alone,\nthat nobody will come with him and that he will\nhave only Guru for his guide and companion and\nshould trust him wholeheartedly.\n    As we said before, many are the paths laid down\nbefore man to choose from and he should decide for\nhimself which is best suited to him, according to his\naptitude, circumstance etc. All the paths laid down by\nour elders are equally good. It is for us to make our\nchoice and, having done so, to faithfully carry out the\ninjunctions laid down. We should realize that same\nShakti motivates and activates every being, the same\nShakti prevails over the entire Universe. To attain the\nsupreme goal, you need a Guru, Vedic teachings etc.,\nas a guide. Hence, it has become traditional for all\nspiritual teachers to preach.

We just want to go into the\nAttributeless and Formless'. But as long as there\nis the 'doing'and the 'experiencing' one has to act.\nSo, act with the intention of connecting to the\nDivine. Our Worship of the Divine is not simply a\nritual. Through it we identify with the Divine and\ngo towards it. We Worship the Divine with the Non-\ndual Absolute as the Goal. It is not with the intent\nto gain some powers to raise money, or do\nsomething like that. So, the goal will determine\nwhether your upasana is pure or if it is corrupt\nor of little consequence.

Otherwise\nwe may even disrespect Ishwara. \"Ishwara has only\nthis Form\"... if we hold on to this notion, then we\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      27             December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nare rejecting the very Anugraha for showering\nwhich He had adopted this form ... by insisting this\nand this is all that is God ... a particular form,\nthat's all!

Your very nature is\nof one Integral Whole in which I too am a miniscule\nelement and I want to melt into that Whole. I don't\neven want to maintain my individuality. With that\nconviction we do the upasana of Lord\nBhavanishankara. So, the insistence on rupa is not\n...needed.

But\nthe intrinsic quality of our Parampara is that - the\nGuidance we receive - whether from a stotra or\nfrom a bhajana, is always Vedanta oriented. The\nbhajanas etc., that we sing with fervor, we then go\nonto contemplate upon them and the same concepts\nslowly begin to reveal themselves. We receive\nGuidance.

That is the\nunderstanding of our culture. You learn, you\nunderstand, and you stabilize that knowledge. Not\nlike - I have heard something, I understood and\nwhen I am asked about it ... then I am not able\nto verbalize. It must be assimilated. That knowledge\nmust be assimilated and converted to conviction so\nthat I can experiment with it. This is Saraswat\nculture. We must ascend and progress in this\nmanner. Having understood the culture, we then\nexpress it correctly. Or else understand and then\nassimilate it. As action or as upasana, if you want\nto increase that, then definitely do so. We insist\non this element.\n                   - Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh 2022\nEka Tattva Nanatva Rupa - Distinct Flavor of\n                Our Saraswat Culture\n   When the Devata is worshipped, for example\nShiva, He loves Abhisheka. There is chanting of the\nRudra, or chant japa of 'Om Namah Shivaya, Om\nNamah Shivaya.' Or while chanting a Shiva Stotra,\nthe abhisheka is performed. With this Shiva is\npleased. He is pleased if Bhasma (ashes) or wild\nflowers or bel leaves are offered. This is a sequence\nwhich that Devata accepts with certainty. That is\nwhen you are showered with His complete Grace.\nWhen Vishnu or Krishna Bhagwan is propitiated\nwith Tulasi. Where? She is revered in the front\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      30             December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ncourtyard. When worshipped with a sprig of Tulasi,\nHe is pleased. Hence some distinction should be\nmaintained. Do you understand? Getting everything\nmixed up is not acceptable. You will not enjoy it\nthen. There is beauty even in diversity. This flavor\nis distinct. This has a unique taste. In the same\nmanner, for whose sake does This One Essence\n(Tattva) appear in myriad of forms (rupa)? For the\nBhakta. One revered Acharya said, \"bhaktyartham\nkalpitam dvaitam advaitadapi sundaram.\" This is the\nknowledge of Advaita (Non-dual). Ishwara pervades\neverywhere. This kind of knowledge is difficult to\nabsorb. So, what do we do? We accept God\n(Ishwara)in one manifested form of our Ishta-Devata.\nSo, when we propitiate the Ishta-Devata, we give the\nsame offerings that are acceptable to Him which He\nenjoys. Ganapati is offered the sweet\nmodakas(laddu) which He loves. Sweets and Durva\nare offered. Then we know ... yes. That is when the\nimpressions are embedded and we start feeling the\nconnection. When you see Durva, you know\nGanapati is worshipped. The moment you see Bel\nleaves, Shiva is being worshipped while Tulasi\nmeans Krishna is being propitiated. We begin to\nunderstand and connecting becomes easy. If you\ndo not understand, you just do not. Just like you\nwould not understand a language. Accepting this\nkind of diversity brings about an understanding of\nthe richness in our culture. The Divine can come\nin varied forms - recognize it.

Give me the competence\nto do that Devi! Such is the prayer of a Saraswat.\nA Saraswat is one who worships Saraswati. He is\nSaraswati's disciple. He is Saraswati's child. Which\nis why the term 'Saraswat.' Which is why he is\ncompletely entitled to say - \"Brahma meditated\nupon You so that He would be able to create. I am\nYours, and so I pray to You - 'saralam saraswatam\ndehi me yasya ammodam udirayanti pulakaih\nantargatah devatah' Then all the Divine forces\nwithin me will be roused awake and whether it is\nexpressing myself through speech, good thoughts,\nwriting or my actions in society, I will be able to\ndo them all because Saraswat's grace would have\nbegunto make an impact at every level. Make my\nlife resplendent in this way Devi.' Every Saraswat\nmay appeal to Her in this manner because he has\nthe right to do so. It is not only the written and\nspoken word, but it is also making his entire life\nmeaningful which marks a Saraswat.\n                                             - Goa 2016\n                (Transcribed by Shrikala Kodikal)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      32             December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Someone or the other will keep troubling\nhim, and that would make him furious too. He feels his efforts\nare nullified because of the trouble. As he thinks more on these\nlines, he gets even more infuriated.\n     In such a situation, he should remain with extreme caution,\nforget briefly the person causing trouble and reflect instead on\nhis own disgruntlement.\n     He should realise that his anger will not only destroy his\npeace of mind but, if allowed to aggaravate, will also hinder any\nachievement. Further, it is detrimental to Dharma, Artha, Kama\nand Moksha and, does no good to anyone. Even grievous misdeeds\ncould be averted if he were to control wrath.\n     If one were to reflect so, he would turn calm and quiet. If he\nthen prays to the Lord with faith and calmness, the situation\nwould become favourable. The person bothering him will also\nchange for the better.

Shrimat  Sadyojat  Shankarashram  Swamiji\nVichaar Koryaan     - For a vibrant discussion\nIt was Arnav's first day at Saraswati Vidyalaya. He\nnervously stood outside his classroom, hesitating to\nenter. After changing three schools in five years, one\nwould have expected this transition to be easy. But\nnot so! Arnav was overwhelmed by the new city,\nnew house, new neighbours, new school, new rules,\nnew books -- new everything! He felt like a fish\nout of water... again!!\nArnav always felt anxious while meeting new people.\nHe had struggled to fit in at his earlier school.\nAfter spending a whole year there, when he had\njust started making friends, his Pappa had announced\nhis transfer to a new city! So, here he was again,\nstanding outside another new classroom of another\nnew school with the same worry -- will I fit in?\nWhen the bell rang, Arnav was left with no choice\nbut to enter. As he shuffled awkwardly into the\nclassroom, he could feel all 40 pairs of eyes piercing\nthrough him. His heart raced as he searched for an\nempty spot, avoiding all eye contact. Arnav looked\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam           37               December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nfor a seat at the back of the classroom where he\ncould disappear behind a tall person and be\nforgotten for the rest of the year. Alas! The only\navailable place was in the front row -- right under\nthe teacher's nose! Arnav reluctantly lowered himself\ninto his seat and smiled timidly at the boy sitting\nnext to him.\nWhen the teacher asked Arnav to introduce himself,\nhe stuttered. In another class, he fumbled while\nanswering a simple question. Arnav's face turned red\nwith embarrassment! By lunchtime, Arnav was filled\nwith anxiety -- 'I have made such a fool of myself!\nNobody will want to be friends with me. I will have\nto sit all alone to eat now. I will have nobody to\nplay with during P.T. I am doomed!' The voice in his\nhead became so loud that he could not hear\nanything else. He hung his head low and pretended\nto search for his lunchbox while he fought back his\ntears and waited for everyone to leave the\nclassroom. When he could not hold his tears back\nany longer, he reached into his pocket for his hanky.\nWhat he found instead was a chit. Startled, he\nopened it to find a hand-written note from his dear\nAmma:\n                       Swamiji Says...\nThe more you surrender and seek refuge in the Divine, the more\nyou will overcome your internal turmoil. Most of your fears\nwill fade away because you are making place for the Divine,\nand what comes forth will be with conviction and strength.\n\nIt felt like Pujya Swamiji Himself had thrown Arnav a lifeline\nthrough this note. Instantly, Arnav's mind was flooded with\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam            38               December 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nmemories of Pujya Swamiji's loving and reassuring smile. He\nremembered how loved and accepted it made him feel every\nsingle time. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths.\nWith every breath, he could feel his body relaxing.\nAs he calmed down, Arnav remembered what his Amma always\ntold him to do when he felt anxious: \"Catch, Check, Change.\nCatch the thought. Check -- 'Is it realistic? Is it helpful?' If the\nanswer is no, change the thought.\"\nArnav realised that his anxious thoughts were neither realistic\nnor helpful, so he decided to change them. He visualised\nhimself enveloped by the ever-protecting Grace of the Guru\nand said to himself, 'There are so many children in this school.\nWith Swamiji's Grace, I will surely make a friend or two.'\nNow, let us discuss...\n\n    *  What is anxiety?\n\n    *  Do you ever feel anxious about anything?

Hence\nit is clear that worship of the Lord becomes the\nmeans of fulfilling one's desires and remedying evils.\nEven neglecting these factors, one cannot gainsay\nthe fact that peace of mind results from such worship.\nDuality is the rule of the universe, and permanent\nhappiness cannot be found in this world.\nAccordingly, Bhartrihari says, \"Although objects of\nsense may last a long time, they cannot but cease\nto exist one day or another. Hence what is the harm\nin relinquishing them right from the start? When\nman relinquishes object of his own accord, a kind of\npeace remains with him forever. But when, after\nhaving been enjoyed for a while, the objects drop off\nby themselves, it is difficult to describe the pain of\nseparation which seizes the mind.\" As declared by\nthe Vedas, therefore, the lasting peace which springs\nfrom the worship of the Lord, is superior to the\nfleeting happiness derived from objects of sense.\nTHE NEED FOR TEMPLES\n(Delivered at Kundapur in November\n1937, and published in Kanara Saraswat\n in February 1938.)\nO DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\nLet my Pranams be in my Deeds.\nTo offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n- Smt. Uma & Shri Arun S. Bolangdy.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 20236\nThe Bhagavad Gita (XVIII-46)  proclaims\nVarnashrama Dharma as one way of worshipping\nthe Lord, but Rishis have also pointed to mere\ndevotion as an independent means. Although yoga\nby meditation is the best in this sphere, few are the\nqualified ones whose minds can be attuned to\nmeditation of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss devoid of\nattributes. It is easier for ordinary people to\ncontemplate, as God with attributes, the Paramatman\nwho is imbued with the illusory Power through which\nHe undertakes the creation, maintenance and\ndestruction of the universe. In this way, say the\nUpanishads, \"By rubbing the under log of one's\nbody, i.e., the mind, with the upper log of silent\nrepetition of the Pranava etc., one can see the fire\nof God emerge.\" Even this worship of the God with\nattributes which has been prescribed for those who\nare on the middle rungs of the ladder, is worship of\nthe Formless and therefore difficult for those on the\nlower rungs to comprehend. Hence to suit the mind\nwhich cannot attune itself to the Formless, is\nprescribed the worship of the God with form. Even\nShri Shankaracharya , the great exponent of the\nNirguna school, has stated in his commentary on\nthe Brahmasutras that the Lord assumes an illusory\nbody at His pleasure for the benefit of the devotee.\nWorship of the Paramatman in the form one likes\nbest, cannot therefore be improper. Where, owing to\nweakness of the mind, contemplation of God with\nform may also be impossible, success may be attained\nthrough the worship of images. Although, mainly,\nliving images like mother, father and Guru may\nhave been mentioned, worship of inanimate images\ntoo does confer benefits according to the strength of\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 20237\nfeeling in the devotee; witness the case of Ekalavya\nin the Mahabharata. Drona declined to teach Eklavya\non the ground that he was a person of low birth, but\nthe latter worshipped an image of Drona, looked\nupon itself at his Guru, so prosecuted his studies,\nand turned out to be more skillful than Arjuna,\nDrona's chief disciple. It is thus clear that even the\nworship of images can lead to success.\nIn praising an image having abhaya mudra etc.\nas the protector of the humble and so forth, there\nis the possibility of virtues of the type taking root\namongst the devotees themselves.\nAlthough the rules relating to image worship\nmay require it to be conducted by each individual\nseparately, this may be impossible in present\nconditions when the battle of life is hard indeed.\nNevertheless, the fact that our forefathers had been\nobserving congregational image worship in temples,\nhas made it possible for us to remember God in\nthese difficult days. \"Sankata bandaga\nVenkataramana\" (\"one remembers Venkataramana\nwhen some crisis is upon us\") : the minds of those\nwho are in trouble naturally run in the direction of\ntemples. Devotion is inspired and strengthened by\nmass action. And more : when, in course of time,\natheism grows and a future generation for any reason\nfinds itself in a state of despair, temples if properly\nmaintained, can be the means of warding off\npossibilities of suicide by reminding people of God\nand bringing new hope into their lives. Hence may\nall who have striven for the restoration of such\ntemples be blessed!\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Likewise, the Vedas and Upanishads\nwhich preach the paths of Bhakti, Karma, Jnana and\nso on, have been kept before us by our ancients so\nthat man who is lost in Sansar will stop crying and\nattain Knowledge. So, the Vedas and Upanishads have\nbeen revealed to us mainly to grant contentment to\nman. Like the child who is crying for some minor\ncause, so also man is constantly crying for one thing\nor the other, because he cannot be happy all the time.\nBy means of the Vedas and Upanishads our ancient\nsages wanted to save man from himself and make him\nattain eternal happiness. Shrutis are the essence of\nVedas, they tell you what your duties are in this world\nand how you can discharge the same and at the same\ntime keep yourself free from the coils of Sansar. These\nShrutis or Upanishads cannot be dismissed lightly as\nworks of fiction or imagination. Our ancients received\nthe Vedas under divine inspiration and they contained\nTEACHINGS OF\nSWAMI PARIJNANASHRAM\n(Summary of the Ashirvachan delivered by His\nHolinessat Vile Parle on 15-12 -1976)\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 20239\nwhat they had actually experienced, the joy of God-\nrealizaion.\nMan may not cry aloud like a child, but he cries\nwithin his heart and mind, because he sees only\nmisery looming large before him. Ninety-nine per cent\nof the people are like that, who have one sorrow or the\nother and are in constant distress. They should stop\nthis crying, they should attain everlasting peace and\ncontentment. Hence, the simile cited by\nShankaracharya, of a Divine Mother anxious to stop\nHer child's cries, offering him the Upanishads, the\nShastras which would enable the people to forget once\nand for all worldly miseries. It is not necessary to\nspecify what is sorrow and what is happiness. Both are\nmatters of experience. Shankaracharya mentions the\nnames of different fruits like grapes, plantains,\nmangoes, dates etc., to denote so many kinds of\nsweetness. Only, the mother knows which sweet is\nwhat and which sweet would make the child stop\ncrying. All that the mother does is to place the various\nfruits before the child which is as good as placing\ndifferent kinds of sweetness before the child. So, also\nthe Upanishads and the Vedas offer man happiness of\ndifferent kinds on tasting which, man will cease to\nhanker for lesser kinds of pleasures. These are words\nof the Vedas and are the Eternal Truth. We must\nrepose full faith and  trust in these words and they\nwill help us overcome our worldy miseries and grant\nus happiness.\nBut as long as man's senses are directed on external\nobjects, he does not attain eternal happiness, the real\nhappiness that is greater than all other joys of life.\nForgetting his true Self, man pursues external objects,\nbelieving that he has no source of happiness in himself\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202310\nand must look outside for it. The Upanishads cite the\nexample of a dog who imagines that the dry bone\ncontains blood and goes on chewing it with his teeth\ntill he cuts through it and cuts his own tongue and\ntastes his own blood and thinks that it is from the\nbone, and derives hollow satisfaction from this feeling.\nSimilarly, man craves for external objects of pleasures,\nfondly imagining that the transitory joy that he gets\nis real happiness. The Upanishads tell us repeatedly\nto think for ourselves, to reason out and realise the\nhollowness of the worldly objects of pleasure, to realise\nonce and for all that the source of real happiness lies\nin our own Self. Attaining that happiness is itself\nattaining Brahman. Once man has reached that height\nof happiness, there is no return for him to the old\nways of life. In fact, he becomes a symbol of that\nhappiness. This is what our ancient rishis, having\nattained that happiness in themselves, have written\nfor our benefit.\nFor most people, it is not easy to attain that\nexperience because they are immersed in Sansar, they\nhave worldly diversions and distractions, mundane fears\nand obsessions. All these may be mere shadows but\nthey appear very real, just as the nightmare one gets\nin sleep appears, for the moment, very real and\nfearsome.\nWe have spoken on the theme of happiness\nwherever We have gone. We truly feel that whatever\nWe have spoken at every Sabha visited by Us has\nbeen inspired in Us by Our Guru Mavuli and what\nHe has taught Us.\nNo man is free from the law of Karma, but he\nceases to feel enmeshed in it if he understands it for\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202311\nwhat it is, namely, the fruits of past actions. To liberate\nhimself, he can tread the path of Jnana Yoga, Bhakti\nYoga or Karma Yoga, the three paths of spiritual\npractice. Jnana Yoga is nor meant for all. It requires\ntremendous amount of concentration and will-power\nas well as severe austerities as one dwells on the\nNameless Formless aspect of the Divine firmly believing\nin the concept \"I am Brahman\" or Aham Brahmasmi.\nUsually, man needs an image of God or God's Name\nto help him develop powers of concentration but in the\ncase of Jnana Yoga, he has to concentrate on the\nNirguna Swarup which is very difficult for most people.\nLord Krishna in His Gita asks us to fix our mind\non Him and dedicate all our actions to Him. That is\nKarma Yoga and it helps one to attain the Lord,\nParamatman. But, this consciousness should be\nconstant and uninterrupted. Man, by nature, is subject\nto all transitory ups and downs of life. He should\ndevelop in himself self-confidence and an inner strength\nwhich can withstand these knocks and make him face\nup to whatever befalls to his lot with equanimity,\nrealising that he is not alone in such suffering and\nthat it is part of the human birth given to him.\nHaving been born a Brahmin, having inherited the\nheritage of Brahminhood by the mere birth, what is\nthe kind of karma one should perform? He should not\nremain content by the mere fact of his being born a\nBrahmin.Real Brahmin-hood means leading a life of\ngoodness and walking on the path to self-\nenlightenment. A Brahmin should practise\nCompassion, Tolerance, Austerity and Devotion,\nwhich take him nearer to God. Only such a one has\na right to style himself a Brahmin.\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Adi Shankara, who refers to it as the\nMantra Upanishad , has provided a comprehensive\ncommentary. The Upanishad is attributed to sage\nShvetashvatara, which literally means a 'white mule',\nas white horses and mules symbolise knowledge.\nA key feature of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad\nis its emphasis on the bhakti or Upasana aspect to\nrealise the Supreme. It has passages allied in thought\nto the Sankhya Yoga , with the Upanishad laying\nequal stress on jnana, bhakti and other spiritual\npaths. It is, thus, an attempt at synthesis of various\nviews to realise Brahman on the lines of the teachings\ncontained in the Bhagavad Gita . The Upanishad\nidentifies Brahman with Rudra, who is conceived as\nthe material and efficient cause of the world as well\nas its guide-cum-protector. The Upanishad contains\n113 verses, or mantras, in six chapters.\nThe First Principles\nWe propose to take some mantras from the sixth\nchapter of Shvetashvatara Upanishad for our Samvit\ncontemplations ( Brahma chintana ). The\nShvetashvatara Upanishad provides a unique example\nof what may be called \" Samvit literature.\" Even as a\npiece of literature, this Upanishad is a rare gem,\nunique in its content, style and treatment.\nThe sixth chapter is, in an abridged form, the\nTHE WHEEL AND THE WEB\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202320\ntotality of the entire Upanishad. The first two mantras\ngive an understanding of the relationship between\nthe phenomenal world and the Creator. The next\ntwo mantras explain how Karma and Jnana help\nthe individual to come to such an understanding.\nThe next couple of mantras bring in the mystical\ntradition. They speak about the nature of the bhava\nwhich is necessary to give meaning to karma and\nbeauty to jnana.\nThe rest of the ten mantras speak about the\nentire gamut of spiritual practice and achievement-\n-the state of realisation, the nature of salvation and\nthe transcendental glory of that oneness which the\nindividual arrives at.\nSamvit Sadhana\nSamvit sadhana , or practice of Self-knowledge,\ndoes not take unnatural postures for the sake of\nnovelty. It expects you to take up the fabric of life\nas it comes and intelligently fashion the outfit\nsuitable for climbing the spiritual heights. Samvit\nsadhana wants you to go deep into every experience\nof life. Everything is meaningful, everything is fruitful.\nYou will have to accept all and rise above them to\nprove your exellence and feel your own divinity. For\nsuch an effort, Shvetashvatara Upanishad  comes\nvery handy.\nThe Upanishad  launches straight into the\nproblems of life or, rather, the beginnings of life. It\nraises this question: \"What is Brahman, the cause of\nthe Universe? From what have we all emerged?\" The\nfirst few mantras of the last chapter give us the gist\nof the whole proceedings.\nJagat Karana\nNow we take up the first mantra : The initial\nnote, the theme of the very first mantra of the entire\nUpanishad is a discussion of Jagat-Karana.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202321\nmJeYeeJeceskesA keAJe3ees Jeoefvle\nkeAe}b leLeecv3es Heefjceg?eceeveee ~\nosJem3ew<e ceefncee leg }eskesA\n3esvesob Ye'ec3eles ye'ie(r)eke'Aced ~~\n\"The far-sighted philosophers declare the world\nphenomena to be the Nature of things, while others\nattribute it to time. But, alas, these are verily\nconfounded. Indeed, the worlds are the glory of the\nCreator. By the power of his mere presence, the\ncosmic wheel rotates.\"\nThe Upanishad exclaims: \"This is the wheel of\nBrahman, the Infinite rotating solemnly to a rhythm.\"\nWho is rotating it? \" Devasyaisha Mahima--the glory\nof the Lord!\"\nThe rishis have studied the issue of jagat karana.\nAfter considering the principle of svabhava (nature)\nand kala -(time), they reject both as insufficient.\nWhen we look at life, we find the flow of time;\nwhatever we try to achieve is swept away in course\nof time. Is there anything really achievable in life?\nKala, or time, seems to be supreme. This instabililty\n(asthirata) or impermanence (anityata) of things leads\nus to the logical conclusion about the asukhata of\nlife ( anityam asukham lokam--Gita ). The endless\n(ananta) alone remains, which we try to measure by\nsome movements as a second, a minute, an hour, a\ncentury, etc. When we try to take the entire cosmic\nphenomena in one sweep, we come to face the Infinite\ntime.\nTime is not making things, time is also being\nmade by things.

We have to go beyond the interior of\nour being to know what 'unrelated-time' is.\nOur rishis dared to go beyond their own being.\nThose who wanted to avoid the issue put up the\nsvabhava theory: The Nature of things is the ultimate.\nThere is no going beyond. If svabhava is a law then\nyou must be able to define it; and there must be a\nlawgiver. Who is this Deva and what is his great\nglory, we will meditate upon in the following chapters.\n(Continued)\n(Courtesy: Samvit Sadhanayana, Mt. Abu)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

You must have heard this a\nthousand times and at least a hundred times you\nmust have said it. \"Happy New Year! Happy New\nYear!\" So the greeting 'Happy New Year' is actually\na wish that one and all may discover more happiness\nfor themselves in the coming year, by renewing not\nthe year, but oneself.\nTime flows on irresistibly. Nobody can stop it. In\nthat eternal flow of Time, it is human beings who\nsuperimpose divisions and names as day and night\nas months and years. To the common folk, 365 such\ndays and nights bring according to their calendar,\na New Year, but in fact, to the large majority, there\nis no newness about it. Every year is a dragging\ncontinuity of the previous year. Every month is a\nshameless prototype of the sorrows and imperfections\nof the previous month. Every today is an echo of a\nyesterday that had passed.\nThe year cannot be changed! This is a time for\nrenewal. This is the reason so many people make\nNew Year resolutions. Year after year they do it. 'I'll\nget up early in the morning. ' 'I must meditate\nregularly. 'Not even for three days are they kept. If\nthe courage to change is absent, no progress is\npossible. Buddha truly experienced a 'Happy New\nYear' when he became the Buddha. One day he\ndecided that he wanted something else out of life,\nand worked towards it consistently. Thus, Siddharth\nblossomed into Shri Buddha.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202324\nThe great rishis of yore analysed and concluded\nthat change for the better can be brought about\nonly by a change in the mood of the mind. If that\nis changed, then changes in one's lifestyle, attitude\nto things, behaviour and quality of thoughts also\nfollow suit. This change has to be brought about at\nthree levels -- the quality ofthoughts, the quantity\nof thoughts and the direction of thoughts. After all,\nthe mind is but a flow of thoughts. Once the thoughts\nchange, we can confidently say that the mind has\nchanged.\nThus, the field of time can be cultivated and\nbrought to bear fruit and profit if we sincerely farm\nour own life. The seeds in the barn cannot produce\na rich harvest unless we plough the land, sow the\nseed, weed out, water the growth, protect it from\ndangers and wait for the ripening. So too, the field\nof time, cannot smile forth to provide us with our\njoys in life unless we cultivate it properly.\nPlough the time with study. Sow the seeds of\nyour own goodness in the ample field of time. Water\nthem with your devotion to the project. As the seeds\ngrow, the weeds also shall strike their roots in the\nsame field and raise their heads. Carefully remove\nthem one by one, and uproot the negativities from\nyourself. And wait till the virtues ripen and are\nready for harvest. One who is capable of thus making\nuse of time and steps up forward in one's own\ninward growth and beauty, that one alone can wait\nfor the New Year -- of glorious promises, of fruitful\nexpectations, of assured peace and guaranteed\nsuccess.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202325\nWhen you change, the year becomes new. You\ndon't have to wait for the first of January. The day\nyou change, it is the 'New Year' for you. You are the\nmaster of your life. A mere repetition of 'Happy New\nYear'\ndoes not make it happen for anybody. The\nunderlying spirit should be a wish that the friend or\nrelative would change their attitude to life through\na process of control, regulation and purification of\nthoughts. Thereby the individual changes, and when\nthe person changes, the world outside is effectively\nchanged. New times, new thoughts have been\ncreated. It is the dawn of a New Year!\n(Courtesy: The Speaking Tree)\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

The birds\nchirped gaily, the trees rustled while a troop of monkeys swung\nfrom branch to branch and a nearby stream gurgled over the\nmossy rocks. After days of incessant rain, the Sun was finally up\nand the animals were all delighted!\nLeela, the playful elephant calf, dutifully followed Amma as\ntheir herd foraged its way through the forest. Amma was busy\nteaching Leela how to find the best food and Leela was eagerly\nabsorbing every bit of it. Every once in a while, Leela would steal\na snuggle with Amma, and Amma would playfully nudge her\nlittle one forward. The herd reached the stream and decided to\nstop for a while. The cool, refreshing water energized Leela and\nshe started prancing. Just then, her friend Chintu sprang a\nsurprise by spraying a trunkful of water on her and Leela too\nsplashed some water on Chintu. Soon, the two were caught in\nanimated conversation and Amma's gentle instructions were\nlost on Leela.\n: Leela's Adventure\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202333\nAs the herd continued to forage through the forest, Amma kept\na watchful eye on Leela and gently nudged her to safety now\nand then, even as Leela continued her friendly banter with\nChintu, oblivious of Amma and the herd. Suddenly, Leela\nspotted a bunch of bananas hanging low from a nearby tree.\nWithout informing Amma, she ran towards it. Chintu too\nfollowed suit, but Amma managed to stop him just in time. The\nrains had made the ground very slushy and Leela slipped down a\nslippery slope. She trie d to climb her way back to Amma and\nChintu but in vain. Agitated, she tried harder. Alas! The harder\nshe tried, the more she slipped until she landed flat on the\nground.\nLeela panicked. While she struggled to get back on her feet, her\nheart was pounding and her mind was racing...  'What if I cannot\nclimb back? What if it gets dark? What if a crocodile is lurking in\nthe marshes below? What if I never see Amma again? What if I\nam banished from the herd? What if...? What if...? What if...?'\nLeela's fears had become so loud in her head that they drowned\nout Amma's voice until Amma let out her angriest trumpet\never  \"Breathe!!!\" Leela was afraid of many things, but\nnothing was scarier than angry Amma. She froze and looked up\nat Amma. \"Breathe, Leela\", Amma repeated gently. Leela took\none deep breath and then another . With every breath, she\ncould feel herself calming down. \"Now stand up slowly,\" Amma\ni nst ru cted.  Lee la fo ll owed  ev er y  in str uc tio n  of\nAmmacalmly.Before she knew it, she had climbed her way back\nto safety. \"I am sorry, Amma. I should have been more\nattentive\", she said remorsefully. Amma patted Leela on her\nhead.\n--\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202334\nThe herd slowly wound its way through the forest. When they\nreached the lake, Amma said, \"Leela, do you see how clear the\nwater is?\" \"Yes, Amma. I can even see the bottom of the lake!\"\nexclaimed Leela. Amma then splashed about in the water till it\nbecame murky. \"Can you still see it, Leela?\" \"No, Amma.\" \"This\nis how the mind is, dear. Only when it is calm, there is clarity,\"\nsaid Amma, as she snuggled with her little one.\nFun Facts: Ele-facts\n1. Elephants are the largest of all land animals.\n2.  At 5 kilograms, the elephant's brain is larger than that of\nany other animal in the world. It also has more complex\nfolds, which makes the elephant one of the most\nintelligent animals on the planet.\n3.  A baby elephant is called a calf. A new-born elephant can\nstand up shortly after birth!\n4.  An elephant's trunk has more than 150,000 muscles\nand tendons.\n5.  Elephants can hold up to 15 litres of water in their trunks.\n6.  An elephant's trunk is sensitive enough to pick up a blade\nof grass but strong enough to rip branches off a tree.\n7.  When elephants greet each other, they twine their\ntrunks together .\n8.  Elephants sometimes comfort their distressed friends by\nstroking them with their trunks.\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam January 202335\n9.  Elephants have an excellent sense of smell and\nhearing but poor eyesight.\n10. Generally, one tusk of an elephant is shorter than\nthe other . It is because the elephant uses it more\noften.

It has an existence not only on\nthe  social  level;  it  is  a  psychic  entity.  Scientists\nwould prefer to call it a field of force, of psychic\nenergy. The heart of it is the Guru, the illustrious\nHead of the Community. It is from this centre that\nthe Community derives its Light and Life. The Math\nat Chitrapur, or wherever the Guru may be staying,\nis the Power-House from which spiritual Life-force is\ncontinually poured out into the lives of the people.\nFor more than 250 years, spiritual energy has been\ngenerated  in  the  Chitrapur  Math  by  the  love,\ncompassion  and  tapas  of  our  Gurus  who  have\ninspired, guided and protected their shishyas and\nshowed them the way of a higher and nobler life.\n    Such a spiritual energy is not merely a concept\nof the mind. One of my earliest experiences is my\ncontact with the great predecessor in office of our\npresent Guru, Swami Anandashram. I was a mere\nboy of twelve brought up in a rather unorthodox\nfamily. But I joined other boys in giving a welcome\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

Even when the crowd\nof devotees had left, a few of the boys lingered near\nour Swamiji. He was silent and we heard, deeply\nintoned, the words: \" Narayan, Narayan\". It had an\nextraordinary effect on me. Even after the passage\nof several decades, I can recall the thrill that so\ndeeply stirred my inner being. I felt rooted to the\nspot and was unwilling to leave. Then came the\nparting blessing and the revered Guru said, very\nquietly and gently, \"Children, it is getting dark; it is\ntime for you to go home\". The words seemed casual,\nbut there emanated from His Holiness a great wave\nof gentle compassion and love that remains as a\nloving and abiding memory of my boyhood. In later\nyears, I was present at the long discussions that\nwere held in the premises of the Samadhi Math in\nMangalore. I was completely uninterested in the\ncaste problem of the day. What, however, arrested\nmy admiring attention was the dignity and\ncomposure of His Holiness Swami Pandurangashram\nwho sat for many long hours without stirring from\nhis posture though the audience came and left when\nthey felt the need of rest.\n   Like many of my contemporaries, I was an ardent\nbeliever in social reform which meant to us the\nbreaking down of caste rules and when, later, my\nfamily was thrown out of caste, I felt that it was only\nright and proper, as social reformers had no business\nto complain if their practices did not meet with the\napproval of the orthodox.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       12                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nIt was shortly after this time, that Swami\nPandurangashram passed away and a mere boy of\n13 was asked to shoulder the enormous burden of\ndirecting and guiding a Community that had nearly\nlost its spiritual heritage. Not only was there an\nopen rebellion against the Math on the part of social\nreformers, but also a more dangerous, because less\nobvious, disregard for spiritual values by which\ngenerations of Indians had lived. The Math was rapidly\nlosing both economic and moral support from\nmembers of the Community.\n   The manner in which the crisis was tided over by\nthe young Guru Swami Anandashram is almost a\nmiracle. It is worthwhile trying to understand how\nthis miracle was achieved. I have already suggested\nthe idea that the Math is a sort of centre of \"power-\nhouse' for generating spiritual energy. Each\nincumbent of the high office of the Guru has, as his\nlegacy, not only the blessing and grace of his Guru,\nbut also the power that has accumulated by the\ntapas   (leHemed) of all the past Teachers of the\nCommunity. This is not a mere theory. Go to any\nplace of pilgrimage, like Benares or Tirupati or\nHardwar, and you will discover a tangible proof of\nthe existence of an atmosphere that is created by\nthe devotion of millions of people. A saint or holy\nperson becomes the starting point of a wave of\ndevotion. The annual pilgrimage of devotees sets up\na sort of movement in the psychic medium by which\nwe are surrounded and centuries of devotion create\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       13                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\na powerful centre of spiritual force. It is difficult to\nwrite about the mysterious energy that we call\nspiritual force. But what do we know about sunlight?\nWe cannot see the sun. We can only see the\nmarvelous world of colour and beauty that it\nilluminates. What do we know about electricity except\nthat it is a power that achieves marvels in the field\nof technology? We talk vaguely about the electron\nthat behaves sometimes like a particle and sometimes\nlike a wave of what, we do not know. We talk of Love;\nof Beauty, of Truth. But the mind and intellect feel\nbaffled when called upon to define these things that\nbelong to a world beyond the mind. We cannot know\nthem except by their manifestations in the world\nthat we know through our senses.\n    Spiritual force also cannot be known except by\nits effects upon the psyche. Though we cannot know\nit, it can be felt by those who are sensitive to it. In\nIndia, and in Europe also, there are great centres of\nthis spiritual energy. These hundreds of places of\npilgrimage attract millions of people who still retain\ntheir sensitiveness to those subtle emanations that\nradiate from these centres. A holy man of unusual\nspiritual power, a great saint or sage, meditates on\nthe banks of a river, or on the top of a hill or\nmountain. He becomes the starting point of a\nspiritual centre, and the devotion of thousands of\npilgrims adds to the spiritual vitality of the centre.\nWhat are its effects and how can we describe them?\nIt is a mysterious radiance that quietens the mind,\ntranquillizes all its restless movements, and makes\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        14                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nit receptive to Divine Grace, to the perception of a\nReality that is beyond the mind. Exposure to such\ninfluence brings us an awareness of the pettiness of\nour small minds and the falseness of our values. At\nplaces like Pandharpur, people completely forget all\ndifferences of caste, or of wealth and position. In the\npresence of the Supreme, how can one be small and\npetty? Even a momentary union with the Divine\nenables us to shed our limited personality, gives us\na larger vision, and brings us a peace that passeth\nall understanding.\n   Our Math is such a centre of spiritual energy.\nEvery one of our Gurus, whose blessings are daily\ninvoked in the evening, has added to the power of\nthe centre. Those who are present at this symbolic\nworship of the Light (Deepa Namaskara) can feel\nthe influence that is being continually poured out\non the Community.\n   It is with the help of this legacy from the past\nGurus and, may I add, the devotion of our ancestors,\nthat Swami Anandashram          has been able to continue\nand maintain the magnificent spiritual tradition of\nour Math. We must remember that he was asked to\naccept the very heavy burden of guiding an unruly\nCommunity that had begun to rebel against many\nof the limitations of caste. He was young, he did not\nhave the contact of his Guru for more than a week\nduring the period of his discipleship. There were\nmany problems that had to be solved: the problem\nof caste restrictions, inter-dining, inter-marriage,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        15                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nwidow marriage and, above all, the problem of uniting\nan extremely unruly Community with a genius for\ncreating unnecessary problems.\n   The technique that was brought to bear upon\nthese problems was simple, but a marvel of wisdom.\nSwami Anandashram does not oppose, he does\nnot argue, he does not resist. He is utterly silent,\ninfinitely patient. He is content to state the truth\nabout any problem, he is humble, willing to listen\nto any one, to any suggestions. His love and utter\nself-effacement are disarming. How can anyone\ndiffer from one who understands you properly? To\nthe \"learned\", the intellectually arrogant, he gives\nthe impression of one who is constantly anxious\nto learn and by this simple method frees them\nfrom their pride of knowledge and learning.\n   He thus teaches by learning. Both are\nsimultaneous processes. Lighting a lamp and the\nresulting illumination are one act. Every teacher at\nthe intellectual or spiritual level has to realise that\nthe task of teaching is the discovery of truth both by\nthe pupil and the teacher. It is joint phenomenon.\nWhen Truth is approached from this standpoint,\nthere is no possibility of discord in the relations\nbetween teacher and pupil.\n                                              (Continued...)\n      (This article was written decades ago - Editor)\n                       (Courtesy : 'Fifty Years of Bliss\"\n                                by Dr. Gopal Hattiangdi)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       16                 March 2024","type":"Document"}

As\nGurudutt said, all we have asked is : do not develop\nthick heads, reflect on what you have heard and\nwhat you are practising. It makes little difference\nwhether you take cow's milk or buffalo milk. Likewise,\nif you are repeating Gayatri Mantra, do not merely be\ncontent with the repetition, go deep into the meaning\nof this Mantra.

So, also, first we\nhave to win the confidence of the listeners and then\nconvey to them whatever Dharmik teachings we want\nto teach them. That is why, we always say - it doesn't\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                           March  202417\n------- PAGE END -------\nmatter if you have many new ideas or go by new paths,\nwhat matters is, with the intelligence given to you by\nGod, how much of our ancient truths you are able to\nimbibe.\n   As we said, Gurudutt spoke of the importance of\nMarch First and stressed the importance of following\nthe Guru. The Vedas tell us that the Guru's feet are\nholy, because they show us the path by which one\nmust tread. But, it is not enough to worship the\nGuru's feet, you must also follow those feet, you\nmust walk by the path by which the Guru's feet\nhave walked showing you the way. That is why the\nGuru's feet are worshipped more than any other\npart of his sacred person. They are our guides and\nour pathfinders. That is why, We said:          March first.\nGod is there, Guru is there and Sadhana Shakti is\nalso there.   We are moving ahead and, if you all\nfollow us, you will not be sorry.\n   We do not ask you to accept everything blindly.\nReflect on what we have said, on what the elders\nhave said and accept it only if you firmly believe in\nit. Man is always in search of happiness. In our\naddress at Matunga, we had said that one's Sadhana\nshould not consist only of bookish knowledge read\nand acquired by him. He should also have mental\nSadhana which is the real Sadhana. We should\ninstal God in our mind, think of Him always and\nworship Him in our mind. Nobody is wholly free\nfrom the entanglements of Sansar. Our elders tell\nus in the scriptures repeatedly \"wake up, wake up.\"\nWhen you have to wake up a child in the morning,\nit is not enough to just tell him to wake up, he will\nnot get up. You have to shake him repeatedly, telling\nhim to wake up. Similarly, our scriptures tell us :\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       18                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\npevce og:Keb peje og:Keb ce=l3ego&g:Keb Hegve:Hegve: ~\n             mebmeej meeiejs og:Keb lemceeled peeie=efn peeie=efn ~~\nThat is the meaning of the repeated emphasis on\n'peeie=efn peeie=efn\".\n    All of us can attain eternal happiness, but most\nof us do not attain it. Why? It is because our vision\nis veiled by the pall of sorrow. Happiness is of two\nkinds, one is the shadow, the other the substance,\none the unreal and the other the real happiness.\nWe are too busy chasing the shadows of happiness\nin our pursuit of wordly pleasures to bother about\nreal happiness. We are seeking happiness outside,\nforgetting its source within us. We have spoken at\nseveral places of the Sport of Brahman, how this\ncreation came into being. The Brahman we refer to\nhere is different from the Brahma of the Trinity\n(Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar). He is the\nSupreme Being, the Primordial Being. He is without\nbeginning and without end, without name or form.\nThat Supreme Being felt like having divine Sport-\nLeela, So Brahman created what we might call a\nsplit personality, called Adi Shakti. That Shakti\ndeliberated deeply why She was created and realised\nthat Brahman wanted to have divine sport and that\nShe must carry out His wishes. So, She, in turn\ncreated Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar and\nassigned them the three respective functions of\ncreation, preservation and destruction. The same\nShakti or divine power pervades all the three\nfunctions. The same Shakti has been carrying on\nthis Leela all the while till now and will continue to\ndo so in future as well. That is what the Shastras\nhave always told us, but to explain it in simpler\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        19                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nterms : a man wakes up, carries on his daily routine\nand then goes to sleep again at the end of the day.\nThese three functions represent creation,\npreservation and destruction and while carrying out\nall the three, the same Shakti works through every\nindividual. So, Shakti is at work in every living\ncreature and all over the world. Such a Shakti can\nbe realised by us in many ways such as Jnana,\nKarma or Bhakti paths. If we look upon Her as the\nDivine Mother and surrender ourselves to Her,\nplacing ourselves at Her feet, She sheds her veil of\nMaya and reveals Herself to us as Adi Shakti Herself\nand liberates us from the coils of a mortal existence.\nWe all have our worldly goals, our mundane aims\nand ends and in their pursuit we allow this precious\nhuman life to be frittered away.\n   But, we should realise once and for all that we\nare not here merely to work out the effects of our\npast actions or sow seeds of new actions but to\nrealise the true purpose of our life, namely, to\nliberate ourselves and attain eternal happiness. In\nother words, we came from Shiva originally but,\nforgetting this fact, we have become \"Shava\" or\nmortal. We must now go back to our original state\nin Shiva.\n                 (Summary of the ashirvachan delivered\n                               at Bengaluru on 26-1-1976)\n\n                  LEST WE FORGET\n P.

Therefore upon entering\nthe Math we first come to Bhavanishankar Mahadev\nin the Sanctum Sanctorum called Hodi Samadhi and\noffer our prostrations. Then we go to the rest of the\nDeities. The normal practice in any temple is to first\noffer prostrations to Ganapati, then to the Devi. But\nhere it is different. That same Shakti endowed with\nthat  motherly  love,  has  come  in  the  form  of\nBhuvaneshwari. So we offer our prostrations first to\nBhuvaneshwari,  then  to  Ganapati,  then  to\nShankaracharya  and  to  all  the  Acharyas  of  our\nGuruparampara. Keep that in mind, the significance.\nSo, in our Math there is Bhavanishankar Mahadeva\n... that is Bhavani and Shankar and also there is\nBhuvaneshwari but they are not different from each\nother!  Shiva  and  Shakti  are  not  different  and\nBhuvaneshwari has come to illumine the Glory of\nthe One  Shivashakti as also to express Her Love,\nAffection and Her Grace. That is Bhuvaneshwari, the\nsignificance of Bhuvaneshwari.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                           March  202421\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Goddess - Her Transcendental and\n                   Immanent Forms\n    So, when Rajarajeshwari is said to be\ntranscendental, it means that She is joyfully\nengrossed in Her own Divine Play of Creation. To\nenter into earnest worship of Her you should be\nwilling to appreciate whatever you perceive, even\nwhen you see the duality as real, as transitory. You\nneed that much detachment. Then you can\nappreciate it, the way She does. If you do not have\nthat kind of toughened orientation, worship Her as\nBhuvaneshwari. I understand your plight, no need\nfor flight. \"I am here for you.\" That is what She says,\nbecause She is the Immanent One. So, that is why\nit is easier to approach this particular manifestation\n- The Goddess of all the Worlds.\n                                        - Mumbai 2019\n\n       The Goddess - Changing Her Form\n                    for the Devotee\n   Rajarajeshwari, She holds the noose, the goad,\nthe bow and arrow. She holds the five arrows of\nthe subtle elements. She manifests sound, touch,\nform, taste and smell and we take it as a composite\n- 'This is the World, the Cosmos' The power which\nmanifests this, those are Her arrows. She creates.\nThe sweet gracefulness with which She does it is\nrepresented by the bow - a stick of sugarcane. Out\nof joy She is doing that! You could say She is\npresenting this universe! Such is Rajarajeshwari.\nWhen She is doing it, out of  in Her joy, She\ncomes as Rajarajeshwari. She is the Cosmic\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam      22                March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nEmpress. But where does that place us? The minute\nwe recognize that, we are stuck. She relents. She\nplaces aside Her bow and Her arrows and first\nbestows fearlessness and then Her boons. She who\nis the transcendental. The Lalita comes as not\nexactly manifest but the Immanent. The Actual\nSource. The very first Force just behind Creation.\nSo She will respond to our pleas and help us in\nour distress. To worship Rajarajeshwari we should\nbe able to recognize the transitory quality of our\nworld, then enter into Her realm. Else it is difficult.\nBhuvaneshwari is more willing to understand\nwhatever troubles we go through, the injustice we\nsuffer and other such. She is accepting our\nignorance, gives us fearlessness, gives us boons and\nensures that we progress spiritually. There is a\nhuge difference - It is not just your spiritual\njourney, not just how you approach, but how She\nresponds. Remember that. We believe that it is our\neffort alone. The Form suggests what that Deity\ndoes. One has to be very careful. The Deity will\ndemand and It will respond in a particular manner.\nIt has been generated for that. So, Bhuvaneshwari\nis not exactly pliable, but at least She listens, She\nunderstands. \"Yes, this part of My Creation is\ncreating unhappiness. I will remove that.\" Otherwise\nI feel the tragedy and comedy as part of the Divine\nPlay as Rajarajeshwari. Do you understand? And\nso, we adoringly worship Bhuvaneshwari. And then,\nwhere does She reign? If in our hearts, then\nwonderful! Else at least in Shrivalli!\n                                         - Mumbai 2019\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       23                March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nThe Goddess - as Mukambika -\n          The Releasor of expressiveness\n   The Goddess Mukambika manifested to vanquish\nthe demon Mukasura. He had been unleashing\nterror everywhere. She crushed him completely. He\nwas the demon who was Muka. The word Muka is\nused to describe a person who cannot speak. We\nsee this in children too. A child might be intelligent,\nbut if he has not yet begun to speak, then that\nchild is quite aggressive. If a child is unable to\nexpress his emotions or his thoughts, then he\nbecomes very violent. Is that not so? So we pray to\nthe Goddess, \"There is good in me, but I am unable\nto express it.\" Who knows it might be because of\ncertain mental impressions, no? \"I engage in\ncompletely unworthy actions O Goddes. So get rid\nof that Mukasura who might be seated in my heart,\nso that whatever is good in me may be revealed!\"\nSo, that is why all of you went there (Kollur) today\nfor Her darshana - to see Her. I heard that there\nwas some programme going on in the Saraswati\nMantapa so you could not go inside. It does not\nmatter. While there, in that sacred space with Her\nclose by, you sang bhajans and you expressed your\ndevotion. Equipped with what you have received from\nthe Guru, you offered your bhajans. That alone\npleases Her. That is what we want in our lives - the\nperfect balance and expression of Shiva and Shakti.\nAs I had told you earlier the first deity of that place,\na Shivalinga, has a line of gold running vertically\naround it. When we look at it, that part which is\nto our right, which means the left side of the\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       24                March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nShivalinga is the bigger part. And the right side of\nthe Shivalinga, that is the one to our left is a little\nsmaller because the bisection is not absolute half.\nThe Goddess is the primary One here. It is Her\nsacred seat. The Goddess's image is also there. She\nhas a face, so that devotees who come here recognize\nHer as the Goddess and so are able to worship Her.\nAnd below the image actually one cannot see it\nsince only the prabhavali is seen, there is a\nShriyantra. The Goddess there was aggressive. It is\nnot an easy job to vanquish Mukasura! And when\nwe go there we need Her motherly love. So, when\nAdi Shankaracharya was travelling through India, He\nwent there - He has come to Shirali too. When He\nwent there, He consecrated the Shriyantra and the\nGoddess became Gentle and Loving. That is why we\nalways pray to Her, \"Let whatever good there is in\nme increase and let me be able to express that\ngood!\" The Goddess is not pleased just by our going\nto Her. She says, \"I am giving you so much! Why\ndon't you express it?\" So we pray, \"You alone should\ndestroy all obstacles! Our lives should be as Shiva\nintended it to be and may the touch of the Goddess\npulse through everything we do. Let us feel that joy\nand express it!\" This truly is the attribute of a Samvit\nSadhaka.\n                                           - Shirali 2020\n\n            The Goddess - Destroyer of\n               self defeating influences\n   Fear, Cowardice - Emotions like these are not\ntolerated by the Guru Shakti where She is\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       25                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nconstantly making Her Presence apparent - such as\nin Samvit Sadhana. And why is that? Because or\n'why' the fear surfaces. It indicates the betrayal of\nour own soul. Worst. Treachery against Shiva and\nthe Guru can be dealt with, if one has been idiotic\nenough to do it. But the repercussions of treachery\nagainst the Self is something that even God cannot\nsave us from! So we have to develop self-assurance\nand then pray to the Shakti, \"Will you destroy\nobstacles?\" She says, \"Yes ofcourse!\" We again pray.\n\"I have to inculcate strength within me. Will you give\nme that?\" She says, \"Here take it! You are My very\nOwn! I shall bestow it upon you!\" Unbeknown to us,\nthere are many corrupting forces concealed within\nus that have been there through lifetimes.\nSometimes based on circumstances, or in a\nparticular situation, they manifest and suppress us.\nWe find ourselves unable to do what we want to do,\nand we wonder, 'Why this is happening? Oh I have\nbecome spiritless!' And so we pray, \"Destroy those\nforces, O Goddess, with just Your Resonating\nPresence alone!\" What this means is, when the\nMantra- the seed Mantra resonates all these evil\nforces begin to lose their power and influence. The\nGoddess simply reduces them to ashes. It is then\nthat our Soul Essence and our faith and devotion\ntowards the Guru comes to the fore and we become\ninstruments of the Divine.\n                                         - Jodhpur 2019\n\n               Universe as the Lila of\n                 Shakti Shankaraloka\n   She creates this universe in Her Own Joy (Lila)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       26                March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nLabdha - created it Sthapita - suatained it and\nLupta again resolved it into Herself. The One Who\ncreates such realms, sustains and then resolves\nthem too. There is One such Shakti. I worship that\nShakti which manifests as Gauri, Bhagavati, I\nworship Her, I glorify Her. There is a Brahma Sutra\nwhich says, \"Janmadyasya yatah.\" The cause of\nmanifestation of this universe      (jagat) is the Brahma\nTattva. With the principle of cause and effect. What\nyou perceive is the Effect. What is its Cause? There\nis only one cause. The effect superimposes itself over\nthe Cause and becomes one with it. The principle\nof Advaita will be grasped thus. So, here as upasakas\nwe worship That Brahma Tattva              in the form of\nBhagwati. That One Shakti as if playfully manifests\nas the world. This Lila is like a child - when taken\nto the beach makes sand castles there and when\nhe sees someone selling ice-cream .... Just destroys\nthose sand castles and runs towards the ice-cream\nvendor. It is just a play. There is no lament saying,\n\"Oh God! What have you done. I had made such\na etc...Playfully creates, sustains it and before\nleaving just destroys it. Similarly there is a Shakti\ntoo, Who out of Her Own Joy, Creates, Sustains and\nResolves. And that is the Shakti which is\ninseparable from Shiva. We will gradually understand\nthis. It is called the Abhinna Nimittopadana Karana.\nIf That is the Cause then It does not need any other\nmaterial to create this universe. Such is the Shakti\nWhom I glorify. By glorifying my speech gets purified.\nBy glorifying I begin to dwell more on That Tattva.\nNormally our speech is engaged in dwelling upon,\ngetting clarity about the worldly objects and our\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       27                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthoughts are also engaged in that. By chanting such\nstotras, gradually samskaras are embedded. Whatever\nI know, there is some Tattva beyond that too. Mind\nbegins to get attracted towards That. This is not\nmere imagination, The Tattva Whom we address and\nglorify That Tattva too begins to bestow Its Grace\nupon us starts attracting us. That is when dispassion\nis also understood correctly. Thus maturity is gained.\nIt is not a one-way traffic. To the extent that we try\nto purify the mind. Not with the thought that I will\nfirst purify my mind and then contemplate on\nIshwara. We meditate on Ishwara and simultaneously\ntry to purify the mind. And gradually our conviction\nincreases that, \"I belong to You only!\" It is then that\nthese nuances begin to reveal themselves.\n                                     - Ahmedabad 2023\n\n     To Shiva, Through Shakti!

Then She is the One Who Rules,\nThe Shakti Who Controls, not dependent on anyone.\nThen in upasana Ishardhangaharam - Here we get\nan indication of Ardhanarishwara. Isha means\nIshwara, The One Who occupies half the form of Isha.\nThat Shiva-patni I worship. But why not do the\nupasana of only The One Tattva or else only Devi's\nupasana. The same Brahmaswarupini or only Shiva's\nupasana Who Himself is the Brahman, so where is\nthe need to differentiate first and then say that They\nare One. There must be some reason. We need to\ncontemplate upon that gradually with humility and\nyet with insistence. Then it is possible for that secret\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       28                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nto be revealed. Our condition is such that we\nperceive the world as an object. So, if we are directly\ntold that this is all an illusion, etc., it will not be\naccepted or difficult to digest. A dichotomy may be\nexperienced. So That Tattva, with Its Own\nInseparable Shakti, Creates, Sustains and Resolves.\nThis does not negate Advaita, Non-duality. Gradually\nunderstanding this Shakti, we can merge into the\nShaktimana as my Real Self. Therefore Both are\nworshipped. In reality, upasana is of Shakti only.\nWhat is Shiva-tattva? It is not a form to be\nworshipped. It can only be Known. It is possible to\nmeditate upon Him as Me, Myself. But if we\nmeditate with closed eyes and chant Shivoham\nShivohm - then it is possible to get confused.\nTherefore when we talk of the Shakti element, His\nShakti Which projects this Creation. Sustains and\nthen at the end Herself gets resolved in Herself\nwhile bestowing the Knowledge of the Shiva-\nswarupa. Such a Devi I worship. She is also the One\nWho Rules and we worship Her in the form of\nBhavanishankara, Umamaheshwara, Shiva-Parvati or\nArdhanarishwara. So the One Who is the\nIshardhangahara, One Who occupies half the form\nof Isha, I worship That Shakti. Gaurim Tam\nAbhiramam, Abhirama - Brahma-krida from kri\ndhatu, abhi-sarvatra.

So this\nindeed is the domain of Shakti Herself! We invoke\nShakti even to pray. Therefore we perceive that\nOneness of Shiva and Shakti in our Aradhya devata\n- Bhavanishankar. Later the pojana is offered to the\nShivalinga for upasana. Vagarthaviva samprktau - vak\nand arth - There is speech- word and its meaning.\nThey are always together. When we say a word,\nimmediately its meaning is revealed, if we know that\nlanguage. If someone says, \"The jam is very hot and\nspicy!\" Does it make any sense? No! We may\nunderstand if we say the pickle is hot. No matter\nhow much we act and try, if we are told - hot like\njam, it can only mean something is jammed! This\nis how the meaning is revealed. As soon as the word\n'jam' is pronounced, it reveals the meaning a\n'something sweet.' That is the meaning that\nimmediately comes to light. So Ishwara and Parvati's\nrelationship also is a mutually inseparable one like\nthis. I meditate upon Them who are Vagarthaviva\nsamprktau. Who are Jagatah Pitarau - Parents of the\nentire creation!

He must act in accordance to what they say,\nwith the firm belief that his parents only seek his welfare.\nEven their rebuke is steeped in love. If man were to\nunderstand this well and live his life, all will be well not\njust for him but for others as well.\n    Nothing could be greater injustice and papa (sin) than\na child, raised with much difficulty by parents, going\nagainst them and making them suffer and reducing them\nto tears. Man must never resort to this.\n    These days, we see people who send their own parents\nto old age homes and lead a life without principles. This\nis unacceptable. If such people were to reflect seriously\non their act, they themselves would realise their mistakes.\n    The physical body is our instrument for pursuing the\nPurusharthas (Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha). This\nphysical body of ours is begot and nurtured by parents.\nSuch being the case, even if a man were to serve\nhis parents for a 100 years, he would still not be\nfreed of the debt he owes them.\n               meJee&Le&mecYeJees osnes peefvele: Heesef<elees 3elee\n              ve le3ees3ee&efle efveJexMeb efHe$eesce&l3e&: Melee3eg<ee~~\n    May all understand this very well and receive their\nparents' love and blessings.\n                                            (Courtsery : Tattvaloka)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam           32                    March 2024","type":"Document"}

Hence      Shri Dakshinarnurti,    being\nthe giver of knowledge, is the best and foremost\nbestower of boons and he makes the least pretence of\nteaching.\n   In most images of       Shri Dakshinamurti     there is a\n(Jejcegee) The same is the case with                   Lalita\nTripurasundari's    form of which     Shri Shankara     sings\nin his  'Saundaryalahri'.

The name under\nconsideration is reminiscent of that expression.\n30)   JejJeerCeesppJeueled keAj:\n    He whose hand is radiant with an excellent              vina\n(a stringed instrument of music).\n    Of the various kinds of          Dakshinamurti-forms,\ndistinguished by the change in the mudras, this name\nrefers to the     Vina-Dakshinamurti. This musical\ninstrument has been traditionally identified with\nknowledge, as is well known in the case of Goddess\nSaraswati. The concept of knowledge here, be it\nmundane or spiritual, is a radiation of the soul light\nand this light has the tendency of travelling in not\nonly particle or wave forms, but also as cascades of\njoy, represented by the tunes and nuances of music.\nWhen asked about what an enlightened person does,\nthe Upanishad says, \"He sits singing the psalms\". The\nmention of the     Vina  is with a deep import.\n    The main part of the       Vina  is the  danda, the reed\nwith a number of cross bars or          parvas   on which the\nstrings are stretched. This symbolizes in the human\nbody the    Meru-danda, the spinal cord, in which lies\nthe psychic apparatus consisting of the subtle strands\nof nadis    and many      parvas-stages of evolution of\nconsciousness. In other words, your body is the            Vina,\nwhich when surrendered to the master, becomes an\ninstrument to exhibit His grace, His glory, the joy of\nlife. That is the significance of the hand becoming\neffulgent or revealed by the       Vina.\n    So, you must make your body            vara  (excellent) so\nas to become fit for His     kara  (hand). Hence excellence\ndoes not consist in externalities, but in the capacity\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         34                  March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nto express the joy or pattern that is in the Great Artist,\nthe Divine Creator. He alone can play upon life and\nbring this grandeur out. And for this, ordinary one-\nstringed instrument will not do. Anyone can\nunderstand that     Dakshinamurti     demands a      Vina. As\na spiritual   sadhana, you must make your entire\npersonality, with all its physical and psychical\nramifications, a fit instrument for the Divine.\n    It is well known that, according to            Vedanta,\nshravana,     manana     and    nididhyasana       form one\nintegrated and the only form of        sadhana    that leads\nto enlightenment. According to the accepted\nsymbolism, the book and the rosary        (japamala)   stands\nfor shravana   and   manana    respectively.  Nididhyasana\nis expressed here most artistically through the          Vina.\nThe more    sadhana    you do, the easier it is for you to\nfeel the subtler touches of the Divine and ultimately\nthe state of    Jivan-mukti    is reached, in which the\nsadhaka    and the   sadhya    are merged. The      upasaka\nbecomes the     Upasya 'Brahmavit Brahmaiva bhavati'.\nThis is the concept of   Dakshinamurti     presented in   Shri\nShankara's     famous hymn. He, the enlightening\nmaster becomes the        Jivan-mukta, the enlightened\nsoul, and plays upon the strings of his own life.\n31)  JeveJeeme-meceguueeme:\n    He who delights in the forest life.\n    Shiva is considered to be particularly fond of\nforests. He is called        priyadavah       (efOe3eoJe:) and\ndavishthah   (oefJe<th:). That suits a mystical nature. Tree\nstands for the mystery of life, and literally it exudes\nan atmosphere of       sattvikata. Experiments in the\nscientist's laboratory, indicate that trees and plants\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        35                 March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ncannot stand cheating and cruelty. Religious texts also\nprescribe tending of plants as a part of purificatory\nrites and other austerities. When various trees are\nthere in a cluster, the effect is much more acute.\nTherefore a   panchavati     (Hermitage made of five trees)\nor tapovana    is recommended. In a natural forest one\nderives the fullest benefit of the spiritual atmosphere.\nIndia's ancient culture has been the                aranyaka,\npertaining to the forest. Therefore it is understandable\nthat Shri Dakshinamurti exults and revels in the forest\nof life.\n32)   JeveJeerjwkeAueesuegHe:\n    He who hankers for the company of hunters in\nthe wild.\n    Shiva  is often depicted as hunter      (vanavira)   or even\na leader of robbers     (Taskarapati)   ! One idea is that, he\nis the common and the only refuge for all classes of\npeople, including the fallen and the frail, the backward\nand the blacklisted, even the demons and defiling\ncreatures of the cremation ground. Being the\nSarvatma    and the Guru, an ocean of conditionless\ncompassion. He loves everyone and keeps the door\nopen for all. But actually the allusion of the hunter,\nobviously, is to the world that is a wilderness for the\nuncontrolled and the unenlightened, something very\ndifficult to pass through without hardship and without\nlosing the way. Only the intelligent and the valiant\nventure into it and cross over. These are the              Viras,\nand the Lord is very fond of such manly aspirants.\n    The   Agamas     give a very interesting definition of\nvira. He who is able to dissolve all 'This' into the 'I'\nand drain the soul-essence        (Denb jmeece=le) completely and\nyet not get so inebriated as to be unfit for transactions\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam         36                   March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nwith the world.

The book, in a slim\nspace of 60+ pages, describes the  philosophic\nexplorations and experiences that Dr. Hattiangadi\nhad, related to our 3rd Guru, HH Parijnanashram II\n(1757-1770).\n\nThe Parijnanshram Swamiji II samadhi is located at\nour Math in Shirali, and visiting it many years ago,\nDr.Hattiangadi tried to unravel the mystery of what\nhe calls the \"Unknown Phenomenon\" through the\ntechnique of \"meditative exploration\" - fervent prayer\nand meditation. The book, the author says, is not a\nfactual biography/Charitra, but an exposition of\nintense personal feelings.\n\nHH Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji has in His\nbenediction for the book commented: 'We pray to Lord\nBhavanishankar that this book may inspire sadhakas\nto do their Guru Upasatti with alertness and devotion'.\n\nDo log in and read this latest addition to our web\nlibrary, and spread the word amongst your family and\nfriends!\n\nhttps://www.chitrapurebooks.com\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        42                 March 2024","type":"Document"}

Shrimat Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji\n\nVichaar Koryaan - For a vibrant discussion\nDo you remember Suraj, the boy who got into trouble with\nhis pranks until he met Pujya Swamiji? (Pssst! You can read\nabout him in the Magha 2024 edition of Little Ravikiran).\nNow, let us see what happened next.\nIt was the last day of his final exams, and Suraj was excited!\nSummer holidays were finally here! He could not wait to play\nwith his friends. So, he rushed home from school. His friends\nwere playing downstairs already, and Suraj did not want to\nmiss the fun. So, he changed his clothes quickly and bolted\ndownstairs.\nA few minutes later, Suraj returned home looking angry and\nupset. He walked quietly to his room and started playing a\nvideo game, but the video game was slow and unresponsive.\nSuraj tried his best to fix it but could not. Frustrated and\nangry, he sat by the window, watching the children play\ndownstairs.\nWhen Amma returned home that evening, she was                 surprised\nto find Suraj indoors. \"Looks like many schools have finished\ntheir exams. Your friends are creating such a ruckus outside.\nWhy haven't you joined them yet?\" she asked.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam              44                      March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\n\"They are not my friends anymore, and they don't want to\nplay with me,\" Suraj replied, fighting back his tears.\n\"But why? Did you do something wrong?\" asked Amma.\n\"Why should it always be my fault, Amma? They have just\ndecided amongst themselves that I am not their friend\nanymore. What can I do about that?\" asked Suraj angrily.\n\"You could start by asking yourself if you have done\nsomething to annoy them...\" offered Amma, but that made\nhim furious. \"Even you are taking their side. Nobody wants to\nplay with me! I tried to play at home, but even the video\ngame is not working. I have been telling Pappa for so long\nthat there is a problem, but nobody wants to help me. This is\nthe worst summer ever!\" declared Suraj, feeling sorry for\nhimself.\nPapamma tried to console Suraj, but he was inconsolable.\nFinally, she said, \"Pray to Swami Dayya.\" Now, that was the\nlast straw! Tears welled up in Suraj's eyes. \"I tried, Papamma.\nI really tried! I have been praying every day and am trying my\nbest to be  good. But they seem to have a problem with\neverything I say and do! What can I do?? Looks like even\nSwami Dayya does not want to help me,\" he howled and\nstormed into his room.\nPappa returned home late that night. When Suraj woke up\nthe next morning, Pappa had already left for work. Now Suraj\nhad to spend another whole day without friends or video\ngames. While he sat by the window and watched his friends\nplay, he had plenty of time to think. He slowly became aware\nof what he might have done to upset his friends. One part of\nhim wanted to apologize and end the matter. But another\npart of him was stubborn and afraid to admit that he was\nwrong.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam               45                      March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nThat afternoon, Amma came to Suraj's room to take a look at\nhis video game. She spent some time figuring out the\nproblem, and then, with just a few clicks, the game was up\nand running. It had some cool new features too! Suraj's face\nlit up! \"That's it? Just a few clicks and the problem is\nsolved?!\" exclaimed Suraj. \"Yeah,\" smiled Amma, \"It just\nneeded a software update. Looks like there were some bugs\nin the software.\"\n\"Was it that simple? I have been struggling with this for\nweeks!\" said Suraj     with wide-eyed wonder.\n\"Yes, the solution was simple, but we made it complicated by\nnot checking for software updates on time,\" said Amma.\n\"Likewise, Suraj, we must be willing to look within ourselves\nto see where we are going wrong. No one is born perfect. Like\nthis gaming software, we come with our own 'bugs', our own\nflaws. By simply praying to Swami Dayya every day, our flaws\nwill not vanish. When we pray to Him for guidance, we are\nonly shown where our flaws are. It is up to us to either fix\nthem or hold on to them.\n\"If we stubbornly hold on to our flaws, we become difficult to\ndeal with, just like this game had become, and we drive\npeople away. But when we are open to correction, we are\ngiven all the strength we need to overcome our flaws. By\nSwami Dayya's Grace, the flaws in the way we speak, think\nand act are removed one by one, and we become better\nversions of ourselves. Now tell me, do you want to remain the\nold Suraj, or do you want to become Suraj 2.0?\" asked Amma.\n\nNow, let  us discuss...\n1) Like Suraj, have you ever made a mistake you were\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               46                      March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nunwilling to admit?

The Shiva Lingam should be duly\nhonoured with the umbrella, flags, chamar fans and other\naccessories. Decorative gates, math-s, temples, monasteries,\nkshetra-s should    be made in honour of Lord Shiva.\nThe Sages asked, \"Most of the Devata-s are worshiped in the\nform of their image. How is it that Shiva is worshipped in the\nform of His image as well as the Lingam?\"\nSuta replied, \"This aspect has been explained by Mahadev\nHimself.  My Guru, Veda Vyasa, explained to me that Lord\nShiva can be prayed to in the form of His image or as the\nnameless, formless Lingam. The Lingam signifies His infinite\naspect of Supreme Brahman, which cannot be limited to any\nimage.\nThe story behind the Shiva Lingam was narrated by\nNandikeshwara to Sanata Kumara, the son of Lord Brahma: -\nOnce, Lord Vishnu was lying down on His serpent bed, with\nattendants taking care of His comforts. Lord Brahma, passing\nthrough, was offended at being ignored. He scolded Vishnu,\n\"My child, I am the Grandfather, the creator of the universe.\nWhy are you sleeping like a naughty child?

You should atone for your\nfoolish behaviour.\"\nLord Vishnu was angry, but with an outward appearance of\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               49                      March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ncalm, replied, \"Oh Dear One, welcome! Please sit on the\ncouch. Why are you so angry? The entire universe resides\nwithin me. You were born from the Lotus that sprung out of\nmy navel. Therefore, you are my son.\"\nThe war of words led to a heated argument which resulted in\na real war! The two Lords wanted to prove their supremacy\nand higher power. Ultimately, Vishnu mounted on Garuda,\nand Brahma, atop His Swan, started fighting with weapons,\nand soon their followers joined the war. Vishnu's\nMaheshwara astra and Brahma's Pashupati astra clashed mid-\nair. Sparks flew and so did awful weapons, pointed arrows,\nterrible spikes - roaring like thunder, whizzing like the wind\nand blazing like ten thousand suns. The Devata-s could do\nnothing to stop the war. They watched the fearsome sight\nhelplessly. In fright, they decided to go to Kailasa and beseech\nLord Shiva to intervene, before the whole universe was\ndestroyed. Reaching Kailasa, they prostrated before the Lord\nand were overjoyed to receive His benign grace and sweet\nwords. Having reassured the Devata-s, Lord Shiva\ncommanded hundreds of His Gana-s to accompany Him and\nDevi Parvati.\nLed by Indra, the Devata-s followed the army of Lord Shiva\nand Devi Parvati, suitably honoured with flags, buntings,\nbands, flowers, fans and other auspices. Reaching the\nbattlefield of Lords Brahma and Vishnu, Lord Shiva observed\nthe scenario from the clouds while the entourage fell silent.\nBrahma and Vishnu were intent upon destroying each other.\nThe three worlds were on the brink of dissolution due to the\neffects of the clash between the Maheshwara and Pashupati\nastra-s. Seeing this, Lord Shiva assumed His bodiless form in a\nterrifying endless column of raging fire in between them. The\nterrible blaze and emissions from the celestial weapons were\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               50                      March 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\npacified and merged into the column of fire, turning\nauspicious instead of destructive. Brahma and Vishnu were\namazed by the tremendous phenomenon unfolding before\nthem.\n\"What is this?\" they wondered. \"Where does this massive,\nfearsome column begin or end? Let us find out together, since\nneither of us is capable of doing it alone.\"\nProud of their prowess, Vishnu\nassumed the form of a boar and\ndove down towards the base of\nthe endless column of fire,\nwhile Brahma, in the form of a\nswan, flew up towards the top.\nTravelling for years together,\nVishnu pierced Patalaloka and\nwent as far down as He could.\nNot finding the end of the\ncolumn, He returned exhausted\nto the battlefield.\nBrahma meanwhile was flying as high as He possibly could\nbut had not reached the top. Lo and behold! A Ketaki flower\nwas floating down towards Him! It had fallen off Lord Shiva's\nhead when He laughed at the folly of Brahma and Vishnu, as\nHe manifested into the endless pillar of fire.\nBrahma convinced Ketaki, \"O fragrant Flower! You must do as\nI ask! Tell Vishnu that I have seen the top of the fiery column.\nIn times of danger, telling a lie to avert disaster is acceptable,\nsay the sacred texts.\" He bowed repeatedly to the flower,\ncajoling it to do His bidding.

I bestow\nupon you a position equal to mine, with your own image,\ntemples, festivals and kshetra-s.\"\nLord Shiva created the extraordinary being, Bhairava, from\nthe centre of his brows. \"Command            me, Master!\" said\nBhairava.\nLord Shiva said, \"Brahma is the first deity of the universe.\nWorship Him with your sword.\"\nHearing these words, Bhairava caught hold of a tuft of\nBrahma's hair to sever the fifth head which had lied. Brahma\nwas remorseful and begged forgiveness. Vishnu also prayed\non His behalf.  Lord Shiva relented, \"The burden of\nadministration of the Universe with the staff is yours. I shall\nalso grant you a rare boon. In all sacred ceremonies and\nsacrifices, you will be the Guru.\"\nLord Shiva then addressed the Ketaki flower which had given\nfalse witness, \"You are deceitful, so I shall not regard you as\nmy favourite flower offered to me in worship.\"\nThe penitent Ketaki flower cried, \"My Lord, if you don't\naccept me, nobody else will, so my birth would become\nfutile.\"\nLord Shiva softened the curse, \"I stand for truth, so I cannot\naccept untruth.

The 8 elements\n- Sarva, Bhava, Rudra, Ugra, Bhima, Ishana, Mahadeva, and\nPashupati are the presiding deities of Earth, Water, Fire,\nWind, Sky, Sun, Moon and the Soul, respectively.

Lord Shiva is seated with his consort\nBhavani on His lap. This was the vigraha that was carried in\nthe jholi by our Adi Guru Parijnanashram Swamiji in 1708\nwhen He arrived on the bank of Kotiteerth in Gokarna.

NAGARKATTI\n\n    In the early hours of the morning, between 5.30\nand 6 one hears a mild pleasing sound of wooden\nsandals towards the southern side of the Math, One\nsees the bare body of the Master, resplendent with\nradiance, standing in the open in all kinds of weather\non the verandah of the Goshala to attend to the\nmorning ablutions. Three-quarters of an hour later,\nthe  same  sound  of  the  wooden  sandals  is  heard\nheading towards the Main Shrine of the Math. The\nMaster gracefully moves on, keeps aside the wooden\nsandals and stands in front of the Main Shrine to\noffer  His  morning  prayers  and  moves  on  to  do\nlikewise  at  other  shrines,  bare-footed.  Meanwhile,\ndevotees assemble aside to offer their pranams to\nthe Master when He is seated on one side of the\nChandrashala sipping a restorative offered to Him.\nThis done, the Master wears the sandals and turns\ntowards the eastern side and, leaving the sandals at\nthe foot of the staircase, goes up the stairs.\n    Completing a short course of yogasanas, which\nforms part of the daily routine, and partaking of the\n\n         O DEVA, my Pranams at Your Divine Feet.\n              Let my Pranams be in my Deeds.\n  To offer our Pranams & this Prayer, we sponsor this page\n            - Smt.

The Master attends to all\nthese interruptions one by one with meticulous care,\nutmost perfection, dignity and grace. There is no\nhurry about the disposal, no hustling, because there\nare many things ahead to attend to. He reverts to\nHis previous work on hand, picking up the link, and\nis soon engaged therein, as if there were no breaks\nat all. Not a single moment is wasted. According to\npriority and urgency, the work that comes before\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        13                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nthe Master is attended to in an unperturbed and\ndetached manner. One notices that He is deeply\nabsorbed in work and yet, out of it. It is here, at His\nFeet, that one learns from actual practice that work\nis worship and, if done with perfection, Yoga. No\nsermons are required.\n   The time spent at His sacred Feet and His\ndivine presence, makes one aware of the meaning\nunderlying His way of dealing with this mundane\nworld -in it and yet, ever mentally and consciously\naway from it. Indeed, one is at once reminded of\nthe classic advice of Vasistha Rishi to Shri\nRamchandra:      Devleml3eeieer yeefnmme*ieer ueeskesA efJenj jeIeJe i.e.\nRaghava, go about in this world with detachment\nwithin and attachment without.\n   Thus, the Master is found seated in that one\nposture of padmasana for hours together until about\n1.30 a.m., when He comes downstairs. After taking\na cold water bath, the Master comes out in an ochre\ncoloured wet kaupina with wooden sandals on. He\nstands in that attire for a while at the corner of the\nMain Shrine, where the dried set of His usual clothes,\nconsisting of katisutra, kaupina, veshti and bairas,\nare made available to Him. The wearing, right from\nthe tying of the katisutra to that of donning the\nveshti, is so impressive and done with such perfection\nthat an onlooker is found absorbed in it.\n   After offering His obeisance at all the shrines,\nthe Master steps into the Sandhya Mantap. There,\nHe performs the most important of His daily\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       14                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nmeditations, namely, anushthana, for more than an\nhour. He devotes that much time under all\ncircumstances, however late it may be. During this\nperiod, so deeply absorbed is He found to be that it\nwould appear to any observer that the outer world\ndoes not exist for Him. If one should learn how to\ndraw his senses inward (antarmukha), the necessity\nof which the Master always stresses in His discourses,\nhe has only to observe Him during the meditation.\nMeanwhile, the daily naivedya and arati are offered,\nfollowed by the mantrapushpanjali ghosh of the\nvaidiks. The Master then partakes of holy tirth-\nprasada of all the shrines, sharing it with Shishya\nSwamiji. Thereafter, His Holiness comes out of the\nSandhya Mantap for padapuja             from the devotees\nwho receive tirtha from Him. They can also receive\nmantropadesh from the Master in the traditional\nmanner. His Holiness's padakanik and tirthakanik\nare counted within ten minutes. The Master, followed\nby Shishya Swamiji, proceeds towards the Bhiksha\nRoom. Here, hastodaka is offered to Him by devotees\nor, in their absence, by a Shukla Bhat. After\nhastodaka is accepted with a Tulasi leaf on the open\npalm, the Master takes His day's bhiksha (food). The\nquantity of food taken is limited under a regulation.\n    After bhiksha which is usually between 1.30 and\n2 p.m., the Master reclines in an easy chair for some\ntime in a room upstairs. It is literally forty winks.\nBetween 3 and 3.30 p.m., His Holiness steps down\nthe stairs to ease Himself and, at 4 p.m., He is up\nagain in the same room seated in Padmasana posture\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        15                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nand drinking a cup of tea. He then attends to the\ntapal (post). The clerk concerned reads the incoming\nand outgoing tapal before him. On rayas patras, His\nHoliness stamps the seal of blessings. He interrogates\nthe clerk, directs the corrections to be made in the\noutgoing letters, dictates telegrams of blessings etc.\nand instructs proper sevas to be performed on behalf\nof devotees seeking His guidance and blessings. Even\nduring the course of this work, interruptions of one\nkind or other take place and, yet, the Master works\nunperturbed.    He is always accessible.\n    The Master at times goes out for a walk in the\nevening. Twice a week, He takes His car for a drive\nto give it the needed exercise, as He puts it. Stopping\nit at a distance, far away from human habitations,\nthe Master, with brown rubber shoes on, starts\nwalking briskly. It is on such occasions and with\nthose fortunate ones who happen to accompany Him\nthat He cuts original jokes which drive them into\npeals of laughter, As, at most other times, His\nHoliness has a serene countenance, it is a treat to\nsee Him in such lighter moments. More often than\nnot, one gets rare spiritual lessons during these\noutings.\n    Between 7 and 7.30 p.m., after deepanamaskara,\nHis Holiness goes for a bath. Then He performs\nanushthana, while Arati, ashtavadhana etc are going\non. When there are night sevas like Kartik Pujas,\netc. His Holiness comes out and sits in his usual\nplace. Here, in the midst of Veda-ghosh of the vaidiks,\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        16                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nHe gives Phala-Mantrakshtas and blessings to the\ndevotes who have done the pujas. On Friday nights,\nHe distributes tirtha. After the pujas, His Holiness\naccepts phalahara and, about three-quarters of an\nhour later, goes to the Western Chandrashala and\nsits in a chair for a little relaxation And reading of\nnewspapers. At times, He engages in conversation\npunctuated with jokes and anecdotes. At 11 p.m.,\nthe Master retires.\n    There are religious functions like Punyatithis\nNavaratri Festivals and Sadhana Saptahs, when much\nof His Holiness's time is taken up by the divine\nservices. His offerings of puja at all the shrines and\ndandavat pranipata before them is worth witnessing.\nWhatever be the number of visitors calling on Him\nto pay their respects, whatever be the strain involved\nin solving the spiritual problems of the devotees\nduring the interview period or in delivering\npravachanas, and whatever be the additional time\nspent on special occasions,        the Master acts with\nthe spirit of service enunciated by Him. \"This\nbody is given to the 'ten'    (Oee peCe) of the Community\nand as such, it should not care for any physical\ncomforts: it exists only for the benefit of others.\"\n    What a privilege it is to write about our Beloved\nMaster!\n\n(Courtesy : Fifty Years of Bliss and Sunbeam, September 1981)\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        17                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Many\npeople have Shraddha, Bhakti but owing to various\ncircumstances, they are not able to visit the Math\nand  Guru.  So,  the  Standing  Committee  felt  we\nshould undertake an official tour which was also\npart of the Math tradition, and we thought likewise.\nSo, from the 22nd of last month, we are on this\ntour, listening to the laity's difficulties etc., talking\nto them about spiritual matters and trying to arouse\ntheir interest in these matters.\n    Adi Shankaracharya in Viveka Chudamani says\nthat whatever be the difficulties man has to face, he\nmakes himself eligible for attaining God Realization\nby the very fact of his having taken birth in a human\nform,  by  the  Grace  of  God.  Shankaracharya  also\nstresses that of all the things needed for man to\nattain liberation (Mukti), God's Grace is the greatest\nMan is always in search of happiness and all his\nday-to-day acts and activities are directed to this\nsole end. In fact, all creatures in this world seek\nhappiness, be they animals or human beings. Adi\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam                                               July  202418\n------- PAGE END -------\nShakti, while bringing into being this creation, has\nplaced all the objects of pleasure outside which keeps\nman distracted no matter how much he might try to\ngo within himself to reach the real fount of happiness.\nThe happiness one derives from external objects is\nnot the real happiness, it could be called the mere\nshadow, and not the substance of happiness. By the\nvery nature of his human birth, man is prey to\nmany ills of the body as well as the mind, and ills\nof day-to-day existence. That is why the Shastras\nask man to wake up and realise his true Self. They\nexhort on him to use his human birth to achieve\nliberation from this mortal coil.\n   The Shastras also tell us how this creation took\nplace, how in the beginning only Brahman, the\nGod, pervaded the entire universe and there was\nnothing else, and how He felt like bringing forth\nthis creation to enjoy His own play. As a result of\nHis wish, He created Adi Shakti to be the active\nforce of creation. Adi Shakti donned the role of\nMaya and, in turn, created Brahma, Vishnu and\nMaheshwar to mobilise the forces of creation,\npreservation and destruction. That is why we are\nasked to turn to the Divine Mother, the Adi Shakti,\nto get over the illusion of Her creation and achieve\ntrue happiness. Man by nature and from his very\nbirth is attuned to seeking satisfaction of his needs\nfrom external objects. As a new-born and an infant,\nhe is completely dependent on his mother and knows\nnothing and nobody else. As he grows older, he\nstarts identifying various objects and people around\nhim as his, and tells himself 'this is mine', 'this is\nmine' and so on, until he is completely submerged\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       19                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nin this world of Maya. Thus, he pursues worldly\nobjects for happiness, forgetting that such pleasures\nas he derives from them are transient and illusory.\nThat is why the Upanishads ask us to turn our back\non these transient pleasures, to renounce them and\nreach out for real happiness within us. Renunciation,\ntrue renunciation is not easy to achieve.\nRenunciation is of wo kinds, namely, Antar-tyaga\nand Bahya-tyaga. The latter means external\nrenunciation of physical objects while the former\nmeans renouncing desire itself for those objects from\none's mind and this is the real renunciation. As\nVashishta tells Rama, real renunciation must be of\nthe mind and not of the body. Physical renunciation\ndoes not have any value if one's mind continues to\nhanker after worldly objects, for which man must\nlearn to control his mind. In today's circumstances,\nrenunciation is more difficult than ever before as\nman is more engrossed than before in worldly\npursuits. So what should he do, because\nrenunciation is absolutely necessary to attain\nhappiness and liberation and yet he is unable to\nrenounce? Our ancients have prescribed many paths\nto follow, to attain liberation according to each man's\ncapacity. Every one must go by the Upadesh given\nto him by his Guru. Upadesh is different from\nAshirvachan, Pravachan etc. which are of general\nnature, meant for all, whereas Upadesh given by the\nGuru is intended for the disciple alone.\nNamasmarana is the ideal path for the present times,\nfor householders to follow, to reach the goal of human\nlife.\n   Bhakti is of many kinds. Merely performing\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       20                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nBhajan, Arati etc. is not Bhakti. Real Bhakti means\nsurrendering oneself completely to God, and coming\nto depend on Him for everything, just as a newborn\ninfant is wholly dependent on its mother and is\nconfident that she will look after all its needs, protect\nhim and so on. So also, man must come to look on\nGod as his sole protector and remain confident that\nGod looks after him all the time. There are three\nkinds of Bhakti. The first is to say I am yours. Just\nas waves rise and fall and might seem to be different\nfrom the ocean, I may appear different but I am\nYours alone. If a man develops this attitude, he can\nattain happiness, by considering himself as belonging\nonly to God. The second kind of Bhakti is to say:\nYou are mine. This gives man tremendous faith in\nHim. You must have heard of the story of\nBilwamangal, the blind devotee of Lord Krishna who,\non his journey to Mathura and Brindavan, fell into\na disused well and was rescued by Lord Krishna\nassuming a human form.However Krishna's touch is\nsuch that it can awaken one's inner vision and\nBilwamangal instantly realises who his rescuer is.\nAs soon as Krishna comes to know that Bilwamangal\nhas found Him out, he runs from the place and\nBilwamangal shouts after Him: \"Where do you think,\nYou are running away from me, Krishna? You may\nrun away from me outside but I have caught You in\nmy heart. See how You can get away from there!'\nThis feeling comes out of the attitude You are mine.\nThere is also Kumarila Bhat's case. His was aggressive\nBhakti in which he used to take the Lord frequently\nto task, so strong was his conviction that the Lord\nwas his. Once he went to Kashi Vishwanath's temple\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       21                    July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nand found the doors of the temple closed. Standing\noutside, he berated the Lord, asking Him if He has\nbecome so proud because of all the devotion offered\nto Him by so many people that He had closed the\ndoors to him. This was not said in anger but in real\nemotion (Bh   av) and staunch feeling of You are mine.\nThis leads us to the third kind of Bhakti, where one\nidentifies oneself with all beings in the feeling of All\nare mine. The sorrows and difficulties of everyone\naround us become ours and, in fact, we come to\nregard the entire universe as our own form.\n   During our stay here (at Talmakiwadi(, we have\nbeen giving interviews in the mornings and many\nare the questions pertaining to Japa. We want to\nanswer some of these here.         Bhakti can be done\nanywhere and everywhere, but Japa cannot be\ndone like that. Sandhyavandan is different from\nPranayam. The Shastras tell us that if man forgets\nhis duty he commits sin and Sandhyavandan is\nprescribed to protect man from committing sins.\nSandhyavandan has its own rules like\nBhasmadharan, Achaman etc.          But, the real object\nof Sandhyavandan is to help us to remember God.\nWhy are we asked to do Japa? Man is not free from\nthe cycle of births and deaths and he goes from one\nbody to another. Once he is born, whether of his\nown free will or unwittingly, he goes on committing\nsins. Japa helps him to vanquish his sins and\ncleanses him of the sins of all his past lives. That is\nthe real purpose of Japa. Why should people in\npresent times perform Japa of Gayatri? Because,\nmerely by listening to our Ashirvachan and the advice\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       22                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ngiven therein, they will not be able to implement it\nbecause of their preoccupation in their worldly duties.\nSo, Gayatri japa is prescribed. It also helps to avert\npremature death. Even if you are to perform Japa\nfor five minutes, after your morning bath, it will\nsuffice. The Upanishads promise that Gayatri will\nhelp man to live upto 100 years. Whether one will\nlive that long or not, there is no doubt that Gayatri\ncan help man to lead a happy and healthy life, he\nwill never be in want and he will attain knowledge\nwithout even reading, he will be revered and\nrespected on all sides and he will endear himself to\neveryone and become popular. All this comes from\nperforming Gayatri Japa.\n   Today is H. H. Vamanashram's Punyathithi and\nwe can do no better than to quote Gauranga\nMahaprabhu's invocation to the Lord and,\nremembering Anandashram Swamiji, offer the same\nto His Holy Feet:\n   \"O Krishna! I don't want to be called a Sadhaka\nor a Bhakta. All I crave for is the dust of Thy holy\nfeet. I don't want people's respect, name, fame etc.\nAll I want is that in every birth, give me intense\ndevotion for Thee. When I remember Thee, tears\nshould fall from my eyes, my throat should get\nchoked, and my body should feel thrilled. Keep\nme, O Lord, ever at Thy feet.\"\n   In conclusion, we want to say that we are much\npleased by all your love and devotion and we dedicate\nthe same at the Feet of Lord Bhavanishankar and\npray to Him to fulfil all your desires and grant you\neverlasting peace and happiness.\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam       23                   July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------","type":"Document"}

Not giving\nroom to unwanted desires is control of mind. Unwanted\ndesires are those whose fulfilment grants us neither\ncontentment nor happiness and only serves to inflict\ntrouble on others.\n\n    We know from our experience that a disgruntled man,\non account of his own greed, suffers.

It is like lighting a candle at night. Whatever\nmay be the power of the lamp, the night is not\nremoved. That is possible only through the rising of\nthe Sun. Similarly Brahmajnana alone can destroy\nthe root-ignorance. If the root is retained, one may\ncut the branches or shear the leaves but they weill\nsprout again and again. Even so, our efforts at worldly\nenlightenment do not provide a solution to the various\nmisconceptions and sufferings, that arise out of the\nignorance pertaining to the very ground of our being.\nHence it is called 'root ignorance'.\n    Sri Dakshinamurti is the only source of\nBrahmavidya and hence he is compared to the Sun.\nThe idea is again elaborated in name fifty-three.\n52)  cete|leceledJeAuHeHeeoHee\n    He who is the embodiment of the fabled wish-\nfulfilling tree.\n    The 'kalpa' tree is said to grant all wishes of the\nperson who takes shelter under it.

Vedanta explains\nthat desire (kama) is an outcome of avidya, ignorance\nof one's own ever-fulfilled joyous nature. The\nignorance has already been referred to in the\nprevious name as the cause of Samsara, which is\nexterminated by the Guru to grant liberation to the\nenlightened soul; but in so doing, what happens to\nthe souls is difficult but all-the same an irresistable\nquestion that arises. Liberation is logically conceived\nto be a state of desirelessness, but will that be\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam        35                     July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\ndesirable? Will it not reduce that living being to the\nlevel of the Insentient, or elevate it beyond the normal\njoyous responses of a healthy life? Though these are\ndeep philosophical issues that have never been\nresolved, the Sadhaka is content to believe that the\njivamukta is as much, if not even more, in the hands\nof God as he was in the advanced stages of sadhana\nwhen total surrender takes place. To such souls, the\nLord's famous declaration in the Gita           'les<eeb efvel3eeefYe3egJeIleeveeb\n3eesie#esceb Jenec3enced\" applies squarely. The Lord fulfills all their\nneeds on the plane of their mundane existence. He\nbecomes their kalpa - vriksha.\n    Another idea is that the word 'kalpa' stands for\n'sankalpa'. The tree of sankalpa refers to that\nexcellent mind ever tuned to the cosmic will, so that\neach one of its sankalpa is a 'shiva-sankalpa', which\ncannot but be fulfilled through fruits of goodness\n(Shivata).

Shrimat Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji\n\nVichaar Koryaan - For a vibrant discussion\nIt was a beautiful, sunny morning at Saraswati Vidyalaya. As\nthe children gathered in the playground, there was\nexcitement in the air! It was the school's Annual Art Festival.\nOnly on this day, the children could sit anywhere in the school\nand create artwork to their heart's content. After days of\nincessant rain, it seemed like the Sun God was eager to join\nthe children and watch the day unfold!\nAvani's heart was racing. Noticing her nervousness, Sanvi\nteased, \"Looks like our champion is all set to win again this\nyear.\" \"Oh, I just got lucky last time,\" Avani tried to brush her\noff. \"Don't be silly! You win this competition every year. You\nmust win it this year too! I am rooting for you,\" Sanvi replied\nand hugged her.\nAvani and her friends settled down on a dry patch of the\nschool lawn. Avani pulled out her magic wand -- her\npaintbrush, and with every stroke, she began to create magic!\nThere was no limit to the number of entries one could turn in.\nAvani was unstoppable! Her imagination ran wild, and her\nbrush matched pace masterfully! All her friends watched in\n\n The Chitrapur Sunbeam               48                        July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nawe as she created painting after painting!\nAt lunchtime, Avani's little brother Aarush came looking for\nher. \"Wow, Akku! They are so beautiful!\" he exclaimed when\nhe saw her paintings. \"Thank you, Aaru. Where are your\npaintings?\" Avani asked. \"I made only one and submitted it. I\nwanted to just play with my friends today,\" Aarush admitted\nwith a naughty smile.\nMeanwhile, there was a commotion nearby. Avani's friends\nwere gushing over a painting that Purvi, the new girl in\nschool, had made. Aarush rushed to see it, dragging Avani\nbehind him. Avani was stunned by what she saw! Purvi had\npainted a busy marketplace. She had captured its vibrant\natmosphere, the bright colours of the fresh produce and the\ndistinct expression of every person skilfully to make the\npainting come alive! 'How could a 14-year-old paint like that?'\nAvani wondered. She felt so small in comparison. It would\ntake her a lifetime to reach that level!\nAvani felt a knot in the pit of her stomach as she turned and\nwalked away from the group. Her mind was racing ahead --\n'Why is Sanvi gushing over the painting so much? She seems\nso eager to be friends with Purvi. Does she like her more\nnow?' Avani was caught in a whirlwind of emotions that were\nnew to her.\nWhile Avani struggled to make sense of her mixed feelings,\nAarush came running behind her. \"Purvi's painting is amazing!\nIsn't she in your class? You both paint so well! You two will\nmake good friends,\" Aarush suggested. \"Oh please, Aarush.\nShe is not a nice girl. Everyone is being extra good to her only\nbecause she is new to the school,\" Avani replied agitatedly.\n\"Why? Did she do something wrong?\" Aarush asked.\nAvani paused for a moment and replied, \"No.\"\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               49                         July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\n\"Akku, you taught me to see the presence of the Devi in\neverything the other day. Don't you feel Her presence in\nPurvi's painting too?\" he asked.\nAvani was dumbfounded by the wisdom in his words. She\nthought for a while and replied remorsefully, \"You are right.\nPurvi's talent is a gift from the Devi. I was so wrong. I am\nsorry.\"\n\"It's ok, Akku. I feel that your talent is also a gift from the\nDevi,\" Aarush reassured her with a smile. He reached into his\npocket and pulled out a sticky bar of chocolate. \"It is Pranav's\nbirthday today. Would you like to share this with me?\" he\nasked. Avani nodded with a big smile and hugged her little\nbrother.\n\nNow, let us discuss...\n1) Have you ever felt envy the way Avani did? Would you like\nto tell us about it?\n2) How did it make you feel about the other person?

The couple were happy,\nrespected and prosperous, but had no children.\nBecause Sudeha badly wanted a child, she implored her\nhusband to marry again. Sudharma accepted Shiva's Maya\nand warned Sudeha, \"The whole universe is a part of the\nParama Atma, so don't pine for 'my son'. Accept Shiva's will\nand serve the Lord. If I marry another and have a baby, you\nwill be envious and unhappy.\"\n Yet, Sudeha forced Sudharma to marry her younger sister\nGhushma.  Sudeha took care of Ghushma lovingly, helping her\nto perform Shiva's special puja for his blessings.\nEvery day, Ghushma would make a hundred clay Shivalinga-s,\noffer puja and immerse them in the lake nearby, till a hundred\nthousand Parthiv Shivalinga-s were immersed.

Unfortunately, this fanned\nthe spark of jealousy into a raging fire within Sudeha. Blinded\nby envy, one night she killed the boy and threw his body into\nthe lake where Ghushma immersed the Parthiva Shivalinga-s.\nNext morning, there was shock and despair in the household\nas the boy was missing and his bed covered in blood, but\nGhushma serenely completed her worship, saying \"Shiva! The\nboy is yours, born with your blessings. Take care of him.\"\nShe then immersed the Parthiva linga at the lake and watched\ncomposedly as her son emerged from it. Shiva manifested in\nall his splendour, pleased with her complete surrender. \"What\nboon do you wish for? I shall punish whoever committed this\nheinous crime.\"\nGhushma bowed, \"O Lord! Please forgive Sudeha! Her sins\nwill be destroyed the moment she sees you.\"\nPleased with this attitude, Shiva granted another boon.\nGhushma replied, \"Please remain here, to protect everyone.\"\n\"So be it!\" blessed Shiva, \"Let this lake be renowned as\nShivalaya and remain full of Shivalinga-s. The next 101\ngenerations of your family will be learned and prosperous.\"\nSudeha came to her senses and begged forgiveness, ashamed\nof herself. Together, the family offered 101 pradakshina-s to\nShiva.\nShiva, as promised, stayed back as the Ghushmeshwar\nJyotirlinga, honouring Ghushma's steadfast devotion.\n\nThe Chitrapur Sunbeam               53                         July 2024\n------- PAGE END -------\nAmmi Shikyaan: Why do we celebrate Guru\nPurnima?\nGuru gives us pure wisdom and it is on this day we express\nour gratitude at His Divine Feet.
